We find Gotta's dislilre of reasoning on religion, his petronizing 01 the old
tradition, exactly reproduced in the ‘Times' for Aug. 23, 1879. “Men of

. the world and especially statesmen are content 10 accept tradition ss it

stands, to treat it with the respect which springs from customary rever-
ence and historic feeling; but any attempt to make it the subject of
inquiry or debete, 10 change it in reference to this disputed doctrine, or 10
defiantly fleant it as the symbol of that new-fangled opinion, can only

inspiro them with greve sorrow at the strange and distorted perspectiva of
the theological mind.” Precisely what (lette might have said 01 any
attempt to reform the religion of Rome.
