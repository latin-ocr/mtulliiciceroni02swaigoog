observes, is changed, the 2nd cause of book 11 (aa comnrodis) being here
placed ard, as Cotta proposes to defer its consideration along with thet of
the 4th cause, and no doubt both of these causes may be fitly considered
under the head of Providenoe, so ss to avoid the repetition occasioned in
the second book by the treatment ol the same topic under different heads
But the question being whether the universe does or does not exhibit signs
ofa creative and administrativa intelligence, Balbus is certainly justified in
protesting, as he does below, against the postponement ol his strongest
arguments and the assumption in the meanwhile that the opposite has
been proved. Itis possible that the subject was really thus divided by
Carneades, who of course had not the argument of Posidonius before him
to answer: he may have briefly considered the argument from comm
and then gone on to examine the proof of the providential government oi
the world

or ill on the lives and fortunas of the beholdem’ (abbreviated).

exconstantla: thia corresponds to the Solar Theory thus described
by Max hliiller (p. 518): ‘I consider the regular recurrence ol phenomena
an almost indispensable condition of their being raised, through the channe
of mythologicsl phraseology, to the rank of immortale, and l give a pro·
portionately small space to meteorological phenomena, such ss clouds,
thunder and lightning, which, although causing for a time commotione in
nature and in the heart of man, would not be ranked together with the im·
