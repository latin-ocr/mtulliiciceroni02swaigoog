Plut. Mor. 387. The subject was often treated in werke of art; Pausaniae
lc. describes an offering by the Mantineam at Delphi, in which Hercules
’ and Apollo were represented as both grasping the tripod and held back,
the former by Athene, the latter by Lete and Ατιοωίς Sch refers to

Nilo natue: Wilkinson (in Bewlinson's Herod 11 43 n.) says there
were two Egyptian goda Khons, the third member ol the Theben tund,

and Meni the ‘splendour of the sun', whom the Greeks identified with l

their Heroides. Heracleopolis was the name of an importent city and
nome in Middle Egypt There was also a temple to Hercules, near one of
the mouths of the Nile, which was visited by Germanicus, Tac Ana 1160

to have given birth to all the gods (Diod. 1 12, Heliod aaa. rx 9). This is
however the only passage, excepting that quoted from Lydus in the Ap-
pendix, in which Nilusie called expressly father ol Herculea The image

of the Idaean Herculea at Erythrae was said tc have come from 'Pyre and ’

· Phrygiae litterae conscripsisse: ‘to have drawn up the Phrygian
traditione ¹. We should rather have expected this to be said of the Idaean
Hercules mentioned below, to whom Diodorus (v 64) ascribes the authorship
of certain charnis and mystic ritca But Wyttenbach in his note on this
place <not on Plut. ia. et 0⁸. lc, as Sela and Ktihner have it) is certainly
wrong in considering our Phrygiae lineae to benothing more than magical
figures. They must be explained by Diod 111 66 την Φρυγίαν καλουμένην
