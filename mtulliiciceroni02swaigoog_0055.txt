tc make sense, and therefore his blunders cre all of ι mechanical
nature. If we set aside these idiosyncrasies, the question misse,
with which oi the other ιιιι is this most closely connected. I think

f the instances given below, which might be multiplied ιο any extent,

show conclusively that it is very nearly cllied to the oldest known
codex, Orelli's V, written in the lOth century, and to the Harleiau
Oodex 5114 Μ, written in the latter half of the ldth century. To
the same group belong the Roman aud Venetiau editions of 1471.
The relction iu which it stands to Orelli’s V is curicus. Where

, there is a second reading in V, tbis is usually followed in the Merton

Oodex (ort), but not by any means universally, not in general
where it is specified thst the correction or marginal reading in V is
written ιιιιιιᾶι nucu, as in 11 69, where Ψ ιιι ιιι correct defluyrc
visse, while Oxf ugrees with Ψ in the reading ὤσαιιι migravisse.
Sometimes sn older reading is preserved in 011, which hes been cor-
rected in V, thus in 11 16 Oxf. ιιι apparent and ue cogitari, where
V bas by correction opporst and nec cogitari ; in ιι 56 V ιιι ιοιιη-
stu by correction, while Oxi. with UOR retains, what was probably
the original reading of V, eo mentita. Sometimes both readings are
combined, as in 11 27 where Ψ ιιι eiefewescaot, Ψ effervescunt, Oxf.
eis ffmescacnt ; 11 127 where Ψ ιιι curm, Ψ morso, Oxf. incursu
morsu. Sometimes we obserre ι general resemblance combined with
slight cnd probably occidental variation, ιι in 11 123 where AB¹V¹
hare doto elephantos (doubtless representing an original captasses),
conected to d. elephanto iu 13¹, to d. clephosmie in PV‘HMR, and ιο
(ι deplacaret iu Oxi. ; in 11 146, where ABEP read et parte meynardi,
V by corr. et erte impendi, and Oxf. crte et tangendi ,· in 11 42,
where Bc rightly give id et, and A¹PV¹ id est, Ψ ιιι id estque,
E idon, and Oxf. mcv idemque. The conclusion to which these
things point, seems to be that Oxf. was copied from V at ι time
when some, but not all the corrections, which are now found there,
had been made. One would like to know whether Orelli's ἰιιιιιᾶι
mmcus' always denotes the same hsndwriting and, if so, what is its
date*. At the same time there ιιι οιιιιίοιιιΙ difficulties in the way
of this hypothesis: for twenty cases, ssy, in wbicb Oxf. agrees with
V against the rest of Orelli's ιιιι, we find one, it may be, in which
Oxi. spprosches more nearly to some of them than to V. Thus in
ιι 86, where Baiter reuda reserarat, hc have et feratu, B temserunt,
