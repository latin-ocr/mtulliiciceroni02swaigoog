was a theological treatise professing to be written by Hercules, just as
the Poemcnder professed to be written by Hermes. Clement mentions
3 that the priests of Isis were required to know by beart the Hermetic
’ books, 42 in number, and that these were regularly carried through the
temple in procession(Strom. v14). We have a specimen of the sacred books of
the Egyptians in the ‘Ritual of the Dead' lately deciphered and translated
Plato alludes to them (Tira 23), where he represents a priest ss addressing
Solon in the words πάντα γεγραμμένα ι’κπιιλαιοῦπῇδ ἐστίν ἐν τοῖς ίιροῑς
...τῆς δι’ ίνθιίδι διακοσμήσεως παρ’ ἡμῖν ίν τοῖς ίκροῖς γριίμμασιν ὀκτακισχιλίων
ι’τιῖν α’ριθμός γέγραπται. We must also distinguish our Phrygiae litterae
from the Φρόγιοι Atym of Diagoras, mentioned by Tatian c. 44, in which
¹ the mysteries of Cybele were ridiculed.

v 14 § 7. Diodorus says (v 64) that Hercules was the oldest of the five
Dactyli and that he founded the gamos at Olympia The phrase employed
by (lic ea Id. Diy. is probably a translation oi a partitive genitive, such
as wc find in the above quotation from Pausanias

rightly, who hsvc established a double cultus of Hercules καὶ τῷ μίν

4). The reading coe isa correction for the mci of uss. On the worship of
Hercules at Cos see Plut Mor. p. 304 and Osann's n. on Cornutus c. ³1.
We do not however read elsewhere that it was addressed especially to the
Idaean Hercules or that it was distinguished ior its mournful character.
