every animal ia a compound of body and eoul; body ie discerptible and
therefore perinhable ; soul is sensitive and therefore liable tc suffering and
death; therefore on both grounds every animal is mortal'; in Gr. some·
thing like this: πᾶν ζῷον σωματικόν rr' ἐστι καὶ ψυχικόν, rb δὲ σωματικὸν
διαλυτόν, τά δὲ ψυχικὸν παθητόν, παθητικὸν άρα καὶ διαλυτὸν τά ζῷον, τὸ δι’
τοιοῦτον πᾶν θνητόν. The reasons why I am disposed to join the two argu·
ments are (l) that the conclusion at the end of the acchon evidently hes
reference to both, and (2) that the twcfold nature of the argument serves
to explain the verbiage and repetition which mark the whole paragraph.
I think however that in any case we must transfer the sentence erqo
ettam-aeternum and place it before camqrw omae animal. We thus bring
together connected clauses and get some reason for the logical partiales:
erpo draws the epecial conclusion from the discerptibility oi body to the
discerptibility of the animal, in the same manner (ιίιὶίοοι) ae the more
general conclusion of the mortality of the animal was inserted from the
perinhableneas of the body. Again, atqui will introduce the minor premioe
aster the major si omna animal tale cat, thus: ‘if all animala sre sensitiva,
there is none which is not liable to be affected from without, and if every
animal is of this nature, none ia nafe from death; but every animal (is of
thia nature, ie.) is framed so as to be exposed to the action of external
forces; therefore every auimd ia liable to doeth and discerptible ’.
