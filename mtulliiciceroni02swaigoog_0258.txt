compar-ison 01 these passages shows plainly that the Subjunctive may ³
11010 the 10100 01 debebat. This use has been generally connected with ¹

the Imperative 10100 01 the Subj.‚ thus accounting 101 the employment
01 110 101 nore, but such an explanation has been challenged 01 1010 3

by two distinguished Cambridge scholare ou the ground that ‘a past
imperative is an inconoeivable thing ’. I presumo 11101 those who used
the phrase ‘past imperative ', simply meant that the Subjunctive 10 this
use stands 10 the Imperative‚ as the phrase ‘you should not 11010

done that' stands to the phrase ‘ you should 001 do that’. Whether 110 ³
0110000 10 speak 01 these 00 different 100000 01 the imperative, is 0 1011101 ³
question 01 00 great importunae: 11 we confine the Imperative to ¹

0000000110 which 010 capable 0110111110001, 01 course we must select

§ at p. 96) 1000 follows ε “ 00001Ιο11 ‘jussivs subjunctives' are merely parte

01 these subjunctivae has led some scholare 10 regard them 00 conveying

to which they might have applied are past...but ne ie merely 0001101001 10

stand to mean ‘whatever right other patriciano might 11010 10 dub ue ¹

Mr Reid‘s note is ‘⁴ editors explain 1110101111 os equivalent 10 caleri 11010101,
