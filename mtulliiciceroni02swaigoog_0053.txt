Mr R Μ. Thcmpson of the British Museum hus kindly exemined
the volume for me end informs me thet the original codex wes
written in Englend towards the end ol' the l2th century. As there
erc only three uss which ere definitely stated to be of sn eerlier
dete, vir. the Vienna Oodex V of the lOth century, the imperfect
Herleien K, end the Leyden Vossianus A of the llth, to which we
may perhsps edd the Peletine (P), celled perantiquus in Bsiter's ed,
it is evidently deserving of e full collation*. The only other uss
which cen rivel it in ege ere two others in the Leyden collection,

1 Orelli's B end O (Beiter’s H) both oi the 12th century, end two

French uss which seem never to heve been colleted, one in the
Notionel Librury et Paris no. 15085, said to be written et the end
of the 12111 century, end one in the Librery et Tours no. 688, ssid to
belong to the seme century. Ι mention these lest in the hopes thet
I may be eble to leem further particulare ebout them from some
of my readers, 'end elec thet Ι may perhaps hear ol other uss of
equul antiquity which heve escaped my notice. Helm in his pre

mentions e codex ol the llth century contained in the Munich
Idbrery (sss 528), but Ι cm informcd byMr Reid thet he cen lesrn
nothing further sbout this from the present Idbrerien.
