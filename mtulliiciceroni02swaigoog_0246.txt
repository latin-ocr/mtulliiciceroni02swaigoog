the nas lt is only by a comparison with the parallel passage in ξ 76
that we learn patrimonia epe berre trcdmdi relinquimus, qne pommus
falle'; dens falli qai potsse? This oi course explains why there cen be no
comparison between the divine gin and the human legaey‚ but the emen·
tial point, that God cannot err, is not mentioned in the earlier passage.
If we transfer the sentences non enim ut patrimonium—solatum from
ξ 71 and place mem after cimelituda we remove them from a context in
which they are unmeaning, and we get a natural explanation for the
question quae est in οοιιοιίοοε r'atc similitudo. Again the sentences be-
ginning qnae enim libito, and injustitiae amera seem ιο me to have no
connexion with those which precede them according to the ns order ; but,
ii we put inpendire—nebesac aiter amice dedit, and then go on with prm
enim labello—c nobb, everything falls into its proper place. Iastly it
seems to me far more natural that the general statement multi endro-
obsuerunt should precede the particular exemplos nec enim Herculi-
poemat, than the reverse 'l'he only difficulty which will theu remain
isthe omission oi the statement contained in § 76 that ‘God cannot make
mistakes aa men do’, which ought to have followed nocere classem but
this omission is easily explicable, if I am right in my general view oi the
dislocation which the passage has undergone. It remeius to account for
the repetitions above noticed in the general argument; and this seem ιο
me most easily done, if we suppose Cicero to hsve written, first ci all, the
ehorter summary contained in ἕξ 69-71, and then to have expanded it in
chapters xm to xxm Medea modo—nemo esce poerit (ἐξ 71-79); and
that both were inserted in the text by the mistake of the original editor.
Or is it possible that Carneades met the Stoic proci of Divino benevolenee
shown in the gin of meson, by a twofold argument, one that which Cicero
gives fully in the lud passage and briefly and conhreedly in the let, vix.
our experience of the mischief arising from the use of reason, which an
infinitely wise Being must have ioreseen3 and the other, thet we cannot
judge oi the intention oi an agent from the result oi his action, because
experience shows that well-intended actions are often harmini and ill-
intended beneficiall If we are to take thie view, Cicero has entirely
failed to distinguish between the two argumente, and has also destroyed
the force ol the latter by introducing his puae eat similitudo, our human
experience being the only ground on which such an argument could he
