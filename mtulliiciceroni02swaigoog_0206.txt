she vas sister of beto wife of Perses and mother of Hecate (see below 5) 46)· .
aocording to the more common tradition (Hyg. Fae. 53, Apollod 1 2§ 2)
she changed herself into a quail to escape from the prusuit of Zeus, and
having afterwards thrown herself into the sea was metamorphosed into the
island Ortygia (Delos). Probably the name Asteria was selected by the
mythologers as approaching most nearly to Ashteroth and Astarte (see
below ξ 59). Thus Lydus (lv 44) ol de* Φοίνικες Ἀστάρην τὴν σφὸν πολιοῦ-
χον, οἱονεὶ τὴν Ἀστερίαν (which, in 11 10 p. 24, he tells us ie a title of Aphro·
dite) ἢ τὴν τὴς ἄστεως άρετὴν εἶναι τὴν Ἀφροδίτην βούλονται. Ampelius c. 9
gives aslightly different account (see Appendix). similarly Damasciusffl'r.
Isidor. 302) calls the Phoenician mother of the gods Astronoa Perhaps

Belus: ie. Baal or Bel (‘ Lord'). It was a title need for Melkarth‚ the ξ

'l'yrian Hercules, and also for the chief of the Babylonian divinitiea, whom ¹

Herodotus identifies with Zeus Diodorus (1 28) and the Greeks generally
say that Belus was son of Libya and Poseidon, and father of Aegyptus and
Danaus, and that he led a colony to Babylon. Herodotus (1 7) makes

Ninus aon of Belus, son of Alcaeus, son of Heraclea Professor Sayee
thinks the Greek Heraclea was derived from the Babylonian Gisdhubar

we should certainly expect it to be introduced by some sort of explanation
