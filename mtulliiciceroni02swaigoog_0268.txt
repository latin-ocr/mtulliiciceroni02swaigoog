Phalaris: tyrant of Agrigentum from abortae. teoto 540. 'I'he
story of the hollow bull of brass in which he burnt his victims is
noticed by Pindar Pyra 1 fin The bull was afterwards taken to Carthago
and then restored to Agrigentum by Scipio (Ver-r. 1v73). According to
Aristotle (lito. 1120) Stesichorus endeavoured to warn the people ol
Himera against allowing Phalaris a body guard, by relating the fable oi
the horse and the stag. Heraclides Ponticus, the pupil of Aristode,
after mentioning the brenen bull and other instrumente of tortura used
by Phalaris, adds ὅνπερ ὁ δῆμος ἐτιμωρήσατο ἐνέπρησε δὲ καὶ τὴν μητέρα καὶ

Apollodorus: tyrant oi Cassandria, the ancient Potidaea, about ac,
280. “After gaining over his fellowcitizens by his profession of an ardent
neal for liberty, he seized the government with the help of a band of eon-
spirators, whom he is said to have pledged in a draught of human blood.
It appears that his tyranny was at first exercised only at the expense of
the rich and for the benedt of the poor. But it was maintained by e body-
guenl of Celts, who were the ready instrumenta of every cruelty; and the
possession of absolute power seems to have tempted him to the worst abusa
oi it'’ (Thirlwall). He was finally overthrown by Antigonus Genetes.
Plutarch mentions Ap. ae an example of punishment inflioted by mental
