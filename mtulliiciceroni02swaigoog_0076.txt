compared the references to Carthage in our beatiss 111 42, 91.
May we then assume 11101 the whole of our treatise is taken from

Clitomachus? Schwenclre notices a difference in the mode of referring
10 the Stoic doctrines, which he would use as a clue to distinguish

between what ie taken without alteration from Clitomachus and what
is added or modified by Cicero. In ᾖ 6-28 we have the Imperfects
dicebas, commemoratae, videbatur, with avident reference to the
former book ; in 55 29-38 we have debitis, dicare 0010111, vobis amiur,
placer, referring to the doctrines of the scoies generally. But I
think we ean only gether from this, that Cicero began his 3rd book
with the idea of meeting the Posidonian argument of the and book
with detailcd criticism horrowed from Clitomachus and supplemented
by himself 5 that, on finding this to be irksoma or impracticable,
inasmuch as the work of Clitomachus was written in reference to the
elder Stoicism and was not adapted to the exposition of Stoical
doctrine subsequently put forward by Posidonius, he in55 17 and 18
abandons the intention announccd in 55 6, 7, 10, of following the
exact order of the previous book, and proposes to defer the chief
part of the discussion on the divina existence to the section on Pro
ridenca As 110 thus breaks lcose from the order of the second book,
adopting instead the independent arrangement of his authority, it
is natural that he should gradually discontinue the Imperfect of refer-
ence, especially where the argument horrowed from Clitomachus is
altogether irrespectire of anything urged by Posidonius, ag. in
5529-34, 70 foll. Towards the end of thebook the and person plural
of the present is used indifferently‚ whether the argument discussed
had or had not been employed by Posidonius, see notes on ric enim
dicitis 5 86, and baec tecum 5 93. Α1 times the Academic criticism
is obscure 00 being directed against arguments or illustratione which
do 1101 appear in tha second book, cf. notes on Hipponax and Cri-
tolaus 5 91 ; at times doctrines 010 attributed to the Stoica which ara
in flat contradiction with the doctrine put forward in that book, cf.
593. “
