narratcd by Mnaseas in the 3rd book of his Europa. Harpocration
cites Mnaseas for the statement that Minerva, daughter of Coryphe,

, daughter cf Oceanus, was the inventress of chariots Tactaes and

Firmicus agree in the story of Minerva slaying her father Pallas
The Orphic hymno illustrate the names Eubuleus, Tritopatreus,
Anactes As Mnaseas is mentioned by three different writers,
Arnobius, Harpocration and Fulgentius, as the source from whom
they have borrowcd, and as hc is a noted Euhemerist of the
Alexandrian school, the evidence, so far as it goes, seems to point

to'him as the mythologist followed by Clitomachus, ia by Carneaden
¹ As regards (licero's summary, it is evidently very incompleta.
He omits from his list the names J uno, Ocres, Neptunus, Mars,

¹. Pluto, Hecate, Pan, Rhea, Proserpina. He sometimes passas over

the common tradition, as that which makes Dionysus son of Semele:

. he omits to note real differenoes, such as that between his three
³ (lapids and the primaeral Eros, or between the Greek and the

Ephesian Diana3 aud makes distinctions where thore are none, as
in the case of Aesculapius, Mercurius and Minerva The frequent

f references to Egypt, the paternity oi Nilus in the cass of five
r deities, the names Thsuth and Phthas and tha ineffable name of

Mercurius would seem to indicate an Alexandrina origin, while
the references to mystic rites suggest a connexion with the Orphic
theology.

In the comparative view, which follows, square brackets denoto
that the statement made is not given in that particrdar place by
Cicero, but supplied from another part of his summary.
