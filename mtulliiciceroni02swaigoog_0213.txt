pyre by Hermes'‚ cf. below ξ 57 00 the second Aesculapius. But we no-
where else (except in the parallel passage 11001 Arnobins given in the
Appendix) find Trophonius identified with Hermes, or represented es the
son of Ischye and Coronis He is the son 01 Erginus or 01 Apollo (Pausan.
1137,Ηο10.Η. Apoll. 296, Schol 00 Aristoph. Not. 508), and is himself
entitled Zeus Trophonius (see on ξ 49) as being connected with the unseen
world, just as he is here entitled Mercury, i.e. ‘Eparia Χθόνιος. The con-
fusion between Troph and Asclep. seems to have arisen 11010 some
resemblance in the rites with which they were worshipped, on which see
Pausan.1x 39. Where the discrepancy 11001 the common tradition is in
any case so great, there seems no justification for changing the us reading
Phoronidis into Cormu‘dia Ovid uses the patronymic Phoroneis lor Io,
as being a descendant of Phoroneus (1110111524), king of Argos. He
makes (l 569) Coroneus (Dr L. Schmitz in Dior. of Aut. reads Phoroneus),
not Phlegyae, the father 01 Coronis. Again Strabo tells 00 (x p. 471) that
Hesiod mentioned a daughter 01 Phoroneus, from whom were descended the
mountain nymphe and the 0010100 Phoronis is also the name 01 000 01
the lost Epioe of Graece, in the fragments 01 which there is a reference to
Hermes and the Idean Dactyls (Lobeck Agyl. 1157).

qui sub terris habetur idem Trophonius: ‘the subterraneae deity
who is also believed to be Trophonius'. The parallel in Arnobius (rub terro
est 01101, Trophonius qai esec 10010101, see App.) seems to show that the
werde must be thus taken. Hermes was called χθόνιος, both as presiding
over the hidden treasures 01 the earth and as the conductor 01 thedoad.

22 Preller (1 586) suggests that the name Πηνελόπη (11010 πήνη, πηνίζω)
may have had a general sense, like our ‘spineter’.

Aemili nefas habent nominare: so the Romane according 10 Ρ10-
tarch (1101. p. 2781) forbade the 0001001 their tutelary deity to be uttered;
compare the feeling 011110 Hebrews about the ineffable Name. I am not
aware 01 any other Greek or Roman authority who makes two Egyptian
gods anewering to the Greek Hermes; but Thoth was worshipped in
Hermopolis under the two forms 01 the Ibis and the Ape; and Lenormant
in his Aac. Huc. of tlw East vol 1 p. 315 tr. distinguishes between the first
Τ110111,11110 ‘was the celestial Hermes, or the personifieation 011110 divine
intelligence'‚ and ‘the second Hermes, who was only an imitation of the
first, and passed 101· the author of all the sooial institutione 01 Egypt'.
npelius and Servius following in the main the same tradition as Cic,
make one god 00101 11104111 and 5th. As far as 1 know it is never stated
that 'l'heuth was regarded as an ineffable name. Herodotus however

osten makes a mystary 01 the name Osiris (e.g.1186‚132, 170), and pro-

‘ sesses his unwillingness to utter the sacred legende, where it was not

absolutely necessary.
