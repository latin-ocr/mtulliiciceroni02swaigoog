· careless but caprioious and for the most part quite indifferent to
making sense. The first two 1 regard ashoncst but somewhat incom-
petent witnesses‚ the writer of P has no intention ιο deceive, but his

inaccuracy almost amounts to dishonesty, while the writer of B, a
lar more competent witness, as far as ability goes, is not satisfied

merely to reportabat deliberately sets himself to improve the read-
ings ol the archetype. It is perhaps unnecessary for me to adduce
any evidence of the carelessness cl APV, as that will be apparent ιο
any one who will glauce over the readings oi a chapter or two in
Orelli¹s edition, but I shall endeavour ιο show (1) that A and V are
independent oi each other, but approach more nearly ιο one another
than to any cl the other nes, (2) that B is connected with the arche-
* type by a different line of descent from the others, and has frequently
preserved the true reading which has been lost by them, but that it
also alters the mistaken readings ol the archetype so as ιο make
sense. The varying disarrangements in BPV seem tc show that
these are mutually independent and are not copied either from A or
from the immediate ancestor cf A ; and this conclusionis confirmed
by the subjoined comparison ol particular readings. Ihave compared
the readings sor the srd book, as tha nss are less imperfectior
this than lor the earlier books. Ι give first those readings in which
the unaltered A and V agree against Bc and P, taking noaccount
of Orelli’s 6th codex E, belonging to the 15th century. In making
ι this comparison it must be remembered that it is only of APV
thet we have the complete readings in Orelli's edition. Where the
true reading is not that ci AV it is given first in round brackets.
Raadings conjectured aa silentio in Orelli’s apparatur caecian are put
in square brackets, as in the critical notes
