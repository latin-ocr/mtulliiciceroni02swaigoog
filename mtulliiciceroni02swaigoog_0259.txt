from what precedes But in his note Mr Reid says “ thie must apparently
be added ιο the cxx. of the eubj. used ιο denote aaa id quad fieret faciamve
areca red qaod fieri datm As such passages are ohan misunderstood,
Inote that they can be most rationally explained as elliptic constructione
in which a condition is expreeeed without ite consequence. We have au¹
exact parallel iu English ; eg. to οιὶοιίε, Albane, marteres may fairly be
translated ‘hadst thou but kept ιο thy word ’. Here the condition ‘if
thou hsdet kept' stands without the consequence ‘thou wouldeet not have
died’'’. Itis ιο be noted that in hie commenta on these two passages
Mr Reid gives inconsistent explanatione of the quotation from Virgil ι in
the one place speaking of the protasis being understood (I suppose, ‘if you
had known it beforehand, you would have kept to your word'), in the
other, oi the apodosia Probably we are ιο understand that he would
make two classes oi jussive subjunctivae, those in which the spodosie, and
those in which the protasis is to be supplied, and that he wordd distribute
the cases under either head as he found it eosiest ιο supply oue or the
other. hir Nixon (J. os Patr. vol. v11 p. 57) says “it is not denied that
there isan important classes socalled ‘jussive' subjunctivee, but of these
those with ne ane intelligible imperatives (aa poposcisset) [on a subsequent
page this macession ie withdrawn], those with arm can always be ex-
plained as hypothetical with or without protasis suppreseed ''. It appears
then that there are three points for consideration : (1) is aa to be regarded
merely as equivalent to aaa? (2) ie it the fact that the Latin Subjunctire
cannot mean ‘ought'l (3) is it possible to explain all ‘jueeives¹ ae parts ol
elliptic conditional propositione? As to (l), no doubt there are compounds
and phrases such as nesae, nequaquam, in which aa retains ite old simple
force, butI think we may safely assume that il ae continued ιο be used with
some one particular construction, however much the words were varied, it
must have been because it was felt that there was something in that construc-
tion which euited the later specialized use of aa And whether, or not, we
employ the phrase ‘past imperative' it cannot be denied that the use ol
ae in such a phrase ae ae poposceras approacher more or lese nearly to the
use of aa to express a wish (as in di ae aeaeae above ξ 75), or a command.
(2) lt appears ιο me that the feeling ofthe Latin writers ae to the meaning
of the J ueeive Subj. is sufficiently shown, hy ite being frequently opposed
to debeo and similar words, cf. the instances cited above from Q. Fr. 111 4,
Paazpp. 11 75, Liv. xnw 37, Verr. 111 195, Salia 25, rra. 11 35 ri eam qaam

also that we find the same meaning in other uses of the Subj. esp. in what
is known as the ‘Deliberative’ usa, with which the J useiwe is coupled in
Tria. 134, cf. Mero. 633 quid eqosoeeram? On. qaid tufam, men' rogae?
