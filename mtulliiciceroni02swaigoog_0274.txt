Dionysius makes a scoffing allusion to the Greek eustom of taking a sip oi
unmixed wine and pouring s libation in honour ol the giver of the grapa
(ἀγαθὸς δαίμων) at the end of the first course, before the tebles were removed
to make room for the symposium ; cf. Aristoph Eq. 85 ἀκραταν αἶνον ἀγαθοῦ
δαίμονος, Vesp. 525, Nicostratus (son oi Aristophanes) in his comedy
Pandrosroe cited by Athen. xv 693 ἀλλ’ ἐγχέασα θᾶπον ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονας
ἀπενεγκάτω μοι τὴν τράπεζαν ιἰι ποδῶν, ἱκανῶς κεχόρτασμαι yde· ἀγαθοῦ
δαίμονας δέχομαι· λαβοῦσ’ ἀπένεγκε ταύτην ἐκ ποδῶν, ib. 11 p. 38, Diod lv 3.
Instead of the formida ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος it was also customary to say
ἀγιιίαα (Becker Olor. tr. p. 329). As the worship of Ὑγιίια uus combined
with that of her father Asclepius, we may suppose that Dionysius on
entering their common temple would pour a libatiou to her, es a signal to
his servants to remove her table, which would probably be a votive offering
and might ewen have her name inscribed upon it.
