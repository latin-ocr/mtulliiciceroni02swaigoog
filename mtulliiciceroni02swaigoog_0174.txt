sed id quod phytiae datur, [also Serv. on lea 16, 834. J. E. B. li.]. So
we have Stoice in Dian 8(uecurate et Stoice Stoicorum semmurum eleseu
diste),¹ diuleenhe and rhetorice in Flu. 11 17. It is strange that the edd.
should take it as the vocative of the noun, which would be cut of place
here, and moreover is regularly uoed of the Epicur-cans, sec 1 77 tu loe,
phyalae, uou cedes with the nn, also 183,1148. The Stoice prided them·
selvas on being dialectici.

nullius tertius: uuna dies (arch. uum clius) est tertius See n. on
testerrw die 11 ta, but here it is implied that a whole day had intervened
between the second and third books, unless Cicero for the moment im-
agined that he was roien-ing here to the first book

dotare vallea: see above ξ 6, and below § 20 ostendere uelles

eune-mentem haberent: it seems best to make this clause depeud
on dura utut (aa Heind. and sch). So taken the sentence exhibite the
same confusion between the objective and subjective statement (quare
murtdm luberet instead of quaere muudum hubae empitetduru esset), of
which we have seen exn before, as in 11 13 (undaret confused with murae)
and 11 167 magau viris prosperae res, e· quidem securitatum eet, n. Below
we have (§ 23) nuit offert quare muudum reticete uti putentur, which might

similarly have been contrected into nuit affert quiere utatur. In the pas· j
saga referred to (11 att-44) Balbus did not attempt to show why the uni· κ

verse was intelligent, but gave reasons for believing that it was so. It is
worthy of notice that Cotta here speaks cf the argument in favour of the
intelligence of the universe and stare as included under the general head
deor ease, thus confirming the view 1 have taken in opposition tc Himel
vol. 11 p. xxi foll.

Oh vm §la interrogaturus: ‘about to examine my argument ’.
From the Socratis elautus the word interrogatio gets the sense of ‘syl-

logim', cf. Fut. 28, Madv. ltu. 139and Reid elaad. 15.
tacitae: ‘without discussion '. Cf. the passive signification of macae,

sudaffpai'lcablur: as by Cic. himself in his treatises cn the subject.
egere confuse: ct. Reid on Ac. 1147.
