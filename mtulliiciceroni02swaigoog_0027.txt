DESIGN AND EXECUTION OF THE DIALOGUE. xlx

there 10 110 0111011101 power to 0110011 the progressos the whole 3 there·
10101110 universe as a whole must 011010 0011001100.

The larger portion 01 the 21111 book is occupied with the subject
01 Providence. This 10 argued lst 1101110111 idea 01 the Divino 1101010
as active and benevolent‚ and ind 110111 the skill manifested in
the universe, which attests the wisdorn 01 the great Artist, just in
the same way 00 the orrcry attests the wisdom 01 Archimedes 'ihc
01111101 the 1110010110 then shown in detail, 101 as regards the earth
and the heavenly bodies, 21111 as 'regards the adaptatione visible in
vegetablc and animal 1110, 3111 and above all in the case 01 man. It
is further shown 11101 the universe exists 101 the sake 01 110 rational
inhabitants, and that all things tend 10 the good 01 man, that pro-
vidential care extends even 10 individual men, that virtue and wisdom
are divine gitta, that the philosopher isdear 10 God end can never
experience what is really harmful.

So 101 Ι think we may be sure that Oicero would gc along with
Balbus. It is 00 more than 110 has repeatedly said in his own
person elsewhere, except as to the Scale 01 Existence, tc which we
find resemblances, it 10 1100, bnt no exact parallel in the passages
quoted in my 110100, There are other parts of hia discourse which
are less in hannony with what we know 01 Cicero’s opinions from
other treatises Such 010 the identification 0111001 with intelligence‚
the ascription 01 1110, thought and 10111100 10 the material 00110100
and the heawcnly bodies, thc sanction accorded bytho Stoice 1ο the
popular mythology 00 representing either the varied activity 01 the
Supremo Being, 1110 personificaticn 01 0111011001 qualitics, or the
divinity 011110 human 0001 3 1ο which we may add the belief in
divination ¹.

When we go on to inquire into the arrangement 011110 2nd book,
there is much to find 1001101111. The 111010 divisione are by nc means
clear. As is pointed out in Vol. 11 p. xxii, much thetis placed under

ality 01 6011, and ascribes 10 him the origin 01 all motion and the fatherhood 01
