§la quael vero-appellet: ‘aa though any os us gave the name of
Jove to him whom you describe as sublime candens, rather than to the God

of the Capitol'. 'l'raditional mythology supplied the conscious belief οι
the mass: so far Cotta is right3 but the Stoice were right in regnrding
that mythology as itself bearing witness to ¹an older belief out of which it
had sprung. One chief source ol that earlier heliel in a superhuman Ruler

was the sight of the heaven, its immensity, its splendour, its order, its
terror; and so far as mythology was associated with the religione instinct,

that old belief still survived under the forms of mythology: see passages
quoted on 11 4 cam caelum ruperimus, Seneca N. Q. 11 45 ac leae quatiere
eadmerum (imperiti) lovan, qualem ia Capitolio et ia cetera cedatur coli-
mus, mellea mana frdmr'aa, sed samm pacm noa Jovem imellepaat, rectorem

compello, qualem dalem qai te solam labec, illa-m thaam da competo, de
ιήοίο, de cenrico totam foll. But ‘men became vain in their imaginatione
aad their foolish heart was darkened’; the ignorant Roman deified the
image of Jupiter or Minerva, as his ignorant descendant in the present
day deifice the image of a Saint or a Madonna. Thus it was thought
that one image worrld be jealous of the honour done to another image οι
the same God, cf. Suet Oct. 91 cum ὠοιίίοαιαιη ia Capitolio aedem Tarenti
Jooi madae superamare, romaico-it quari Capitolinam Jovem crdtoree sibi

placeat motastada ; Philodemus de Mas. in Zeller ιν 253 ‘the Stoic cannot

rely on the commus Gerulum, as he holds the mass in contempt'. The
argument is met in a different way 162. We have the Stolo rejoinder in

Sext Emp. 11 63 foll. ‘not only the mass, but the wiso, the poete and =
philosophare, admit the Divina existence; and as, in debating matters of ’

sense, we should trust the evidence of those who possessed the keenest
sight and quickest ear, so in matters oi reason we should trust the wisest ³.
