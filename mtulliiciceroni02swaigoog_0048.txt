xl rurrronucrros.

ἓ 75. (dedisses), dedisce E and before erasure os one letter B.

579. locum conficiteur di ABEP, heum conficitur di V by
carelessness, corrected in V' into conficit utrum, in 0 into eori-
ficit ut.

581. septimum consul ABV¹, septimus c. OE, septies e. PV',
both corrections 'of alces common construction.
., 583. qui cunrad by corr. in BV, qui quod cd ABOPV, qui
quodcum ud E The original reading was probably quom.

586. quasi eye...de fundo...P. Rutilii aim questus ABPV, in-
stead of the last four words OE ingeniously emend protulissem
questus.

I add a few exemplos from the earlier bools

1 5. 111 eurem (l, cicurum ΑΕ, tetrarum Β. Probably α had
eteorum with 11 superscript over lst letter.

117. aerum A (and perhaps a), aeqri B, fretum (to govern
following judicio) OE.

124. 1151115111 0, utinen A, utinen 13¹, oti ΒἘ. Probably A
ι represents a, corrected in B and O.

1 36. (vi diviua esce), rit divina ease Α, ut divinem esee B Oxt,
ut divina eit E. Itis plain that A is a misreadiug of c arrd that B
and Ε are corrections to make some kind of construction.

137. (sententia rt qui α), renuntias qui ABE, sentim qui 0 (to
make a government for the following qui).

1 43. quoius ABE, cujus 0.

144. sere cerretat ΒΕ, fieri constet AOP. ProbablyB preserres
the original, altered into a more common phrase by the others.

149. viderit OE, viderat ΑΡ Oxi, uideat B. Both 0 and B
seem to me conjectural emendations of rideret.

1 58. L. Crasso interpolated by ΒΕ, omitted by AcP oxs. and

no doubt by α.

163. tienne aperteB by corr. from nort ea parte, nonne a porte
Ac, none aperte E. Perhaps in α one line may have ended with none
a and the next begun with perte. Il so, it would seem that B was
corrected srom the original

1 65. doce P, doces ABOE Oxf. Isuppose we must assume that
P is a correction from doces in α.

166. ueri terren similiora A, veri simili lameri sinrilierc PB'
eud (reading simile for circili) B¹E, veri simile tamen si nulium 0.
I think P represents u, the scribe of which began to write similiora
