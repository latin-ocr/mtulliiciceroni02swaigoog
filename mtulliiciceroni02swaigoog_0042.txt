been mistalren for dand that in V the letters were wrcngly groupcd.
This seems 11 show that A is independent cf V.

fi ll. Scyrum A, all others are allured by the easier 1111111.

5 22. inanimamur AB²v¹‚ inanimotcrum B¹V¹E, 1111111111 O.
There can be little doubt that the archetype (α) is represented by A
and that the commones form is written by error in B¹V¹.

B¹OEV¹ have by carelessness ducis, PA⁹V¹ dicia, B' (11111.

589. quideme A (so Baiter), quoidam amicos the other uss,
except that 13² has quidem. It seems more likely that A should
have overlooked amicus than that it should have been inserted
by the rest

Prae 1111 praecem by B olona.

54. parum, pontem AV¹E‚ parvo OV'. Probably α had porti,
which being followed by occepi would suggest parva or parvam .· or,
if Madvig ia right in reading cepi, occepi may have arisen from
parua cepi in a, in which casa B's reading would be an emendation.

§8- quod 11111 perspicuum BV', where Av¹ have q. est p, and
OE q. 11 p. probably by mere carelessness.

511. 111 tu contineatis: here V has tuq„ Neque, Ac tu quoe,
E quc tu. I am inclined tc think that the q. of V (and probably 11

α) was intended to be tha first letter 11 curatoriis, spelt with qu for 1,
like quotto for 01111, quoinquinari for 111111111νὶ, 1111111111 111

reading of the following word, 11111111 111 the 1111111111· 11 BV, seems
to have arisen srom requiro sequuntur, the eye of the scribe passing
from the 111 to the fud qu. 11 so we must suppose an intermediate
link between o and AV on the one side, as between α and B on the
other side, the former linlr having 11111111, changed by V¹ into
secuntur, the latter preserving the reading 11 a
