αιιίοιιιι Deo ιοηυιηιιιιιιι. Dean Mansel in his notorious Ζιιιιινιι maintained
that we cannot argue from man's view of right to God's view of right, and
therefore thst objections founded on the supposed immorality of Scriptura
were unworthy of consideration. The logical consequentes of his theory
were pointed out at the time in Maurice's book on Revelation, and are now
sufficiently'evident to all See H. Spencer First Principia ch. 4.

prudentiam: we find the same definition in Sext. Emp. rx 162, 11 170
(cl Στωικοὶ ἄντικρύς φασι τὴν φρόνησιν, ι’πισπὶμην οὖσαν dyadis eat κακῶν καὶ·
οὐδετέρων, τέχνην ὑπάρχειν περι τὸν βίον), ib. §§ 184, Ι246, Diog. L. v1192.
The argument however is differently given in Sextus 1x 162, ‘to know these
things he must have experienced them, eg. he must have experienced pain,
and it has been shown that ιο ιι sensitiva to pain is to bs liable to death ',
(abbreviated). On the cardinal virtues see Plato Itep. 1v427f011.

cul mall-maloram this would appear to follow from ιιι marim
common to all the philosophers, that God can neither do nor suffer evil,
see on 1 45 quod baama Τιι fallacy lies in the ambiguity attaching
to ιιι word ‘evil ³. On the Stoic supposition, God being interested in
the world, which He administers, if any evil befel it, He would himself

⁹ feel itas evil, and therefore exercise the faculty which discriminates

between good and evil; but in reality all evil is overruled by Him for

ratione—intellegentia: cf. nu. on11 147. The words are often joined
together to express the pure intellect, Dic. 1 70 qaae amem pars animi
ναιιινιιι atqve iradlepemiae ιιι particeps, eum tum murima ripere ιιιοι plari-
mam αιιιι a corporcr Orat. 10 (Plato idere) ait semper ιιιιαιναιίοιιιιι
ι’νιιιιιιριιιιι aeritimi ; Off. 111 683 fica 2 (ιιι eternal) ιἰιιιιιιριιιιιι et
ιαιίιηι ιοιηρνιιιιιιιίιιιη Lep. 1 27. Here however raab mirsi have its
special force of ratiocinatior, as appears from the clause which follows, cf.
Acad. 1126 arpacrena‘ coracinet, qaae ert Graece ἀπόδειξις, ιιι dgfiadur,
ratio quae er rebus perceptis ad id, qaod aec percipiebatur, αιιιιιωιι. What
then is the force of inerepare? Probably it refers to the full realizetion
of the meaning of each term in ιιι argument, as contrastad with the
recognition of ιιι logical connexion of the propositione, cf. Acad. 1192
antiquorem ιἰιιιιιιριιιιιὶιηι cmrdrrdeadvpae reticerent, Iacent. 11 160 erde-
9rntia eat per queam crimea ea perspicit qaue runt. Or should we take
it more generally, ιι in the verse quoted from Sir John Davies by Whewell
Laetare ort Ιιιαιοιι aad Underctandinp ; ‘when she (ιιι mind) rates things
and moves from ground to ground, the name of Reason she obtains from
this: but when by reason she the truth heth found, and standoth firm,
