nc. 408, when the three ancient tribes or states combined ior that purpose.
The Rhodian genealogy is thus given by Diod v 56: ‘Helius and Rhodus
hed seven sons, of whom only two, Ochimus and Cercaphus, continued in
the island: these joined in building the city 01 Achaia (also mentioned by
Ergias the Rhodion ap. Athenaeus vm p. 360) ; 01 which Ochimus was the
first ruler. After his death he was succeeded by his brother Cercsphus.

gods distributed among themselves the various oountries 01 the earth.
Agsin the name 01 Acantho is unknown iu connexion with Helios. The
nymph Rhodus or Rhode is usually represented as daughter 01 Poseidon
and Amphitrite or Halia, and as the bride, never the mother, 01 Helios.
thtever may have been the original reading, it seems to have been curly
changed into something like its present form, as 1110011 appears in the
locutive both in Ampelius and Amobius, and the latter makes Acantho
