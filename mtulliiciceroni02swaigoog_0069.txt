That Carneades was the great source 01 111 criticism 01 81010
doctrines and especially 01 Steic theology is evident from Cicero‘s
own 1011111111). 11 162 Carneadea libenter in Stoicos invehebatur,

might therefore assume 1 priori that the argument 01 the Third
Book was taken from him, even if it were not distinctly stated
in regard to the prooi that no animal can be eternal(11129),
and iu regard 10 the sorites showing the impossibility 01 drawing
any line between the divine and human in the traditional my-
thology (111 44). The same thing appears from the 9th book of

Sextus Empiricus Ado. Mass. where we meet with many 01 the ,

arguments used by Cicero. Thus, at the commencement 01 the
discussion on natural causes, Sextus declares his intention not to
dwell too much on points 01 detail or run to the immoderate
length 01 Clitomachus in refuting the dogmatista, but to sum up
the most important arguments 011 both sides and allow them to
balance one another (lx 1). As the whole discussion is 01 inte-
rest 101 this as well 1111011110 earlier books of our treatiss, it may
be worth while to give a short annlysia referring to the parallel
passages in the N. D. The positive argument is probably taken

in part at least 110111 Posidonius, sea Introduction on the 80111001 ,

The discussion in Sextus may be divided as follows: (A) The
origin 01 religious belief, (1) positive argument ἓξ 13-28‚ (2) negative
argument ἐξ 29-41. (Β) The 1101 01 tha divine existence, (1)

(Α) The origin 01 religion has bean ascribed to the earliest legislatore
