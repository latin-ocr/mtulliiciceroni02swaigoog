wAs THE NATURA DEORUM PUBLISHED DURING THE
Llrn-TIME OF CICEROl

In the preceding bsssy indicatione ol hasty composition have been
pointed out, and it hasbeen remsrked thet some passages present the
appearance of having been made up of two alternative versione of
the seme original, both of which have been inserted by mistuke If
this is so, it would seem thet the book must heve been published
without the authors revision. Are there any facts which would
confirm this suspicioni .

The conclusive proof that the book did not receive the finishing
touches from the hand oi its author, is to be found jn the inconsistent
allusione to the time occupied in the discussion Thus, in 11 73 we
lind the conversation of the lst book alluded to in the words o tc ipso
hestemso die dictum est, and in 111 18 the rud book is alluded to in
the words omnio qeise a te studius tertius dicta sust 3 from which we
should infer thet the whole discussion must have occupied four days,

. giving one day to esch speech. But il we look back to the beginning
of the 2nd end 3rd books (quae cum Cotto dirrs'sset tum Velleius 11 1,
pisos cum Balbus dixisset tum arridens Cotto 111 1), we find no hint
of any break in the conversation. The only reference to time is in

, 11194quonioot advesperascit debis uobis diem aliquem ut contra isto

’ dicamus, which certainly implies thet the conversation hsd occupied
only one day. There is no difficulty of this kind in other dialoguea ·
In the Tusculons (1 8) Cicero distinctly says dismm quinque scholas
irs totidem libros contuli, und there is e formal notice of the close of
one dsy end the beginning of another in 1 119, 11 9, 10, 11 67, 1117,
111 84, 1v 7, v l, 11, with e separato dedication or prefece to esch

ἵ book. In tho De Finibus the first two books are supposed tube
spoken continuously st Cicero’s villa st Cumae, the 3rd end 4th on

*aa different occasion at Lucullus' Tuscnlen villa, the 5th in Plato's
Academia at Athens.
