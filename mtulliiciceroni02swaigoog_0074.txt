oi things indifferent, among which things trouble is included But the ,

knowledge of trouble cen only be gained by experienoe of trouble itself,
not, as some sey, from the experienoe of pleesure by imagination of the

opposite. For pleasure, being only ιιο removal oi pain, is unknowntoone ι

who is ignorant of pein; not ιο mention that being itself (as the Stoice
say) a kind of dissolution it implies mortolity ἐξ let-166 (N. D. 11138).
So for εὐβουλία, since all deliberationis of the uncertain, and if there are
things uncertain ιο ιιο deity, why may it not be uncertain ιο him whether
the infinite mey not oonoeu'some power capable of destroying him‘l Such
uncerteinty would naturally give rise to sear, which implies mortality
§§ 167-170. On the other hund, if nothing is uncertain ιο him, he must
know evorything ιγ instinct without art, therefore he must be without
the art of life, which is virtue, and being without virtue he must heve
its opposite, vice ξι 171-173. As ιο temporanee (σωφροσύνη), this
cannot exist without prudence (φρόνησις), as is shown by its name, and it
has been proved that this virtue is inconsistent with deity. Again, tempe-
ranoe involves the existence of appetites ιο ιο resisted, which iscontrary
ιο our idea oi deity §§ 174,175(Ν. D. 11138). If God is without virtue
he is miserable, ii he hes virtue thereis something superior ιο him (the
perfectiori or virtue of a thing being superior ιο ιιο thing itself); if neither
of these contradictories is true, ιο must be non-existent ἕξ 176, 177.
Once more, (lod has either the faculty of speech or he has not; the letter
is absurd and contrary to universal belief ; but if he has speech, he must
Δ also possess ell those parts oi the body which conduco ιο speech, which is
an idea only worthy of the Epicureens; he must also speolr in some
partinrler dialect, end if so how will ιο express himself ιο those who
use another tonguel Therefone, as before, he must be nonexistent ἕξ 178,
179. So,if God has a body, it meist be either simple or compound: the
compound is lieble ιο dissolution, the simple is inanimato and irratioual

We have also on this point the following sorites of Carneades preserved ἵ

then Achelous and Nilus, and every river end torrent. But these are not

gods, therefore neitheris Zeus ἐξ 182, 183 (N. D. 11143, 44). 11 the sun is ¹
