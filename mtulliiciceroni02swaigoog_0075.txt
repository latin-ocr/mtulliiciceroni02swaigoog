firmed in this course by the contradictione and impieties of the wulgar
belief and ol the mythological traditione collected by the pocts and theo-

logicus ἕξ ror-194 (cf. Ν. Ι). 111 ea, es-eo).

Itis evident irem the above analysis that Cicero and Sextus
must have bad the same book of Clitomachus before them, but that
both must have used much freedom in omitting and abbreviating‚ ss
indeed Sextus avows §§l, 190. Even in the paragraphs distinctly
cited by both as taken from Oarneades‚ viz. that on the necmsary
mortality cf all animal nature (N. D. 111 29-34, Sext. ἓξ 137-147)
and the Carneadem sorites (N. D. 111 43-52, Sext. ἐξ 182-190),
there are great divergences; eg. as to the sorites respectiug Jupiter
and his brothers, Cicero gives us his reductio ed absurdum through
Orcus, Sextus his through Poseidon, both no doubt included in the
original. A comparisou of the argument, in Cicero and Sextus
respectively, proviug that virtueis incompatible with the divine
nature, shows what liberty the former allowed himself in cutting down
his original. The difficulty is to understand on what principle he
acted: sometimes, as here and at the end of the second boolr, he
omits what is interesting aud important, or gives it in sucha con·
densed form as to make it barely intelligible‚ while at another time
he wearies out the patience of the reader with the sutility ol the
mythological scotica.

It is worthy of note that the two arguments ior which alone
(licere cites the name Carneades are just the two lor which he is also

named by Sextus. At first sight this would suggest that the
remaining arguments in both must have been taken from some

other source than Clitomachus; but it seems more probable that tho
latter, and perhaps Carneades himself in his lemures, brought
together scepticsl arguments from all quartem, assigning each to its
original author, as for instance Alexinus is cited by Sextus ἓ 1083
so that all I should infer from the above coincidenceis that Oar-
neades claimed these two arguments as his own special property.
There is another treatise, besides that of Sextus, which in certain
points strongly resembles this book oi Oicero's, and thatis his
own trectise De Divinatione written immediately after it. From my
notes on5 14 it will be seen that the argument on the gmnndlessness
and uselessnass of divination is almost exactly the same in both
treatises‚ but the name of Carneades is prefixed to the corresponding

' portion ol the latter treatise (Diu. 11 9, cf. ib. 15-25). Clitomachus

is further cited by name Dio. 11 87, and Hartielder detecte his pen in
