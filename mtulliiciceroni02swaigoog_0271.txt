18, where the Locrian speaker, complaining 01 the plunder of the temple
in the Hannibalian war by Pleminius, the legate, refers to the sacrilege

, 01 Pyrrhus, and says 11101 he was the first who had ever veutnred 10 lay

hands 0111110 treasures (01101101, ad enm diere). The senate condemned
Pleminius and ordered restitution 10 be made. Diodorus (11111114) 10111

011 1. 11 would seem therefore that neither Livy nor Diodorus accepted
the story here told hy Oia, which in fact is hardly credible on other
3101111111, es Locri was the native place 01 Doris, the wife 01 Dionysius, and
was also 01 grem use to him in his wars against Rhegium end other states
01 Magna Graecia, senices which he repaid by repeatedly enlarging its

seem to be all spoken 01 1110 elder Dionysius 11 11 possible that Cic, or
his authority,has written 1001101· Crotona and Proserpina 101 1110101 because
we read that the elder Dionysius plundered the temple 01 Ηο10 Lacynie at
Crotona, and sold 10 the Carthaginiense 101 120 talenta the oostly robe 01
the goddess, which had been presented as a 101110 ofl'ering by the Sybariie
Alcimenae, see the references in Grote vol. xr p. 31. He also pillaged the

ad Peloponnesum classem appulisset: we are nowhere told that
Dionysius visited Graece in person, and Victorius (Ver. Lacr. 111 10)
followed by Grote (vol 111 p. 35) is probably right iu supposing that cie.
here conscende the temple 01 Zeus at Olympia with a temple 01 the
Olympian Zeus at Syracuse. Two such are mentioned, the Ὀλυμπιεῖον hy

1 the river Anapus, spoken 01 by Thuc 11 64 and Liv. xxrv 33, and that

situated in Achradina, which Cic calls ternplum eyreyr'rcm ‚Iovis Olympii
