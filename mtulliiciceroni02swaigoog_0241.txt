shut it ’. R] Becker (Gallus tr. p. 282 folh) referring tc the same passage,
concludes from it that the rep. “allowed ol the door being opencd with less
trouble than by the aera, and that, as the name occure only in the plural,
a crosa beam is not denoted by it, but two bolte meeting from opposite
sides (usually of wood‚ Plin N. Η. xvr 42 ξ 82)”. Rich has sn engraving
of this (Gomp. p. 549). Aa it is plain that both explanatione are merely
guesscs, it is worth while to consider whether anything may be learnt
from an examination of tha word itaeli. Rapopcdum might be used either
of ‘that which fixes back', or oi ‘that which unfixee', ‘unfaetene’‚ euch as
a key. It is hardly likely that tha same word would be employed in two
auch opposite sensas: the passage in Festus is ambiguous, and in any case
' we cannot be sure that Verrius may not have invented a meaning to suit
. this particular line. Moreover the lact that the plural form alona is found
in this connexion, suita better with fasteninge, such aa Marquardt de·

’ ’ scribes, than with ahandleorkey. Ithinkalso that the idea oi ‘fixing

back' euits better with his ‘stays’ than with Beckerh bolts. If however
they were usually of wood, they could hardly be suspended from a ring
iixad in the door: it would seem more natural to suppose that they were
removable bars reating on sockets and placed obliquely between the folding
doors and the poeta The word is also used of barricre in the racc-course

tpcatautea praesidat aidhaet Ouarar, canedo equo celat rapupadum qawddam =

ir it were the custom for these bars to be handed over to the conqueror as
