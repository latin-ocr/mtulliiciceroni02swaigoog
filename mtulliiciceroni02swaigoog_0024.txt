Ἧιο and portion of Bk 1 contains the Epicurean polemio against Ἴ

the orl-hodos theology, Platonis and Stoic. It touches on many Ι
interesting points, but it does no more than touch on them 3 its ἵ

critioism is addressed as usual to the gallery‚ very much in the style
of the altercatio with Olodius, oi which (licere writes with such

complacency to Atticus (All. 1 3), and for the most part consiste of

a series of exclamatory questions, which are assumed to be unanswer- ἵ
able, though the arrswer may be distinctly given in the words of the ἕ

treatise criticiaed¹. The more rational objections, such as those which
turn on the possibility of Orestion at a particular moment of time,
on the motives which could be supposed to influenoe the Creator, on
the imperfectiori visible in the work of Orestion, are never directly
met by succeeding speakers. No one seems to pay any attention to

them. Just as it is afterwards with the Academic criticisms on the ⁸

Epicurean and Staio systema, there is no right of reply, uo judicial
weighing of opposing arguments, uo honest endeavour to carry out

even the principle of Carneades and ascertain precisely to which side ’

the balance of probability inclines.

The review of the history of religious opinions contained in the ,

following sections (ἕξ 25-43) is, as I bave already remarlred, the great
blot on this first book. It would be hardly going too far to say that, as
regards the prae-Staio philosophy, it does not contain a single strictly
accurate statement ora single intelligent criticism. It may be said,
this is the fault not of (licere but of the Epicurean authority whom

he follows 3 Cicero merely gives it as a specimen of Epicurean , η

ignorance and prejudice. But if it was intended as an exposure ζ
of this sort, why is it that, so far from giving any hiat to that
effect, so far from correcting any of the blunders of Velleius, Cicero

afterwards makes Cotta compliment Velleius on the accuraoy of liis J

sketchl The real fact is that Cicero himself was in all probability r
unconscious of the inaccuracies which fill the historical section, and

that some at least of these inaccuracies (as may be proved by a
comparison with the fragments of Philodemus) arose from his own
