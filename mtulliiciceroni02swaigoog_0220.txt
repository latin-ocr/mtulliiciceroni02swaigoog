spuma mats: Hea Ttaoy. 196. Noindependent authorityspealrs
of Mercury as father of Cupid.

Jove et Diona: Homer Il. v 312, 370.

Anteros: ie. ‘the response of love'‚ also ‘rivelry in love'; whence
he is here and by Lydus made theson of Mars Pausanias (1 emmen-
tiens an altar to him at Athens, and at Elis (νο 23).

syria cyoroaae concepte: this agrees with Lydus τετάρτην τῆς
Συρίου καὶ Κύπρου, end Ampelius Cypri et Sym'us fitia, but it is a very
strange expression. Conceptus is never used with the simple Ablative (like
procreata above), nor of both parents; and moreover Syria and Cyprus are
both feminine. If it were not forthe parallel passages I should be disposed
to read a Syrio Cyproque accepm ‘ borrowffl from Syria aad Cyprus ³, cf.
Herod. 1 105 ‘'l'he temple of Uraniae Aphrodite at Ascalonia the most
ancient of all the temples to this goddess3 for the Cyprian temple, as the
Cypriane themselves admit, was built in imitation of it; and that in
Cythera was eracted by the Phoenicians, who belong to this part of Syria’;
Hes. Ἠιοορ. 199 Κυπρογενέα δ’, ὅτι γέντο πολυκλύστῳ ε’νὶ Κύπρῳ. If the
reading is right, it may have originated in a misunderstanding of the
epithet Κυπρογένεια, just as Κορυφογενὴο may have suggested a Coryphe
aa mother of Minerva

Apollinis matrem: see above ξ 55. Ampelius and Firmicus 16 make
Minerva daughter of Vulcan, perhaps from a misunderstanding of Plato
Tim. 23 on the part of some earlier writer.

om Nilo: cf. Plato Tira 21 Ι) (of Sais) θεὸς ἀρχηγός ris· ἔστιν, Αἶ-
γυπιοτὶ μὲν τοῦνομα Nam, Ἑλληνιστὶ δέ, eis ὁ ἐκείνων λόγος, Ἀθηνᾶ, Herod. 11
62 with Wilkinson's n, Plut Is. θεον. 32, ib. 9, where she is identified with
Isis and the famous inscription is given, ἐγώ εἰμι πᾶν τὸ γεγονὸς rol ὃν sal
ἐσόμενον, rai τὸν ἐμὸν πέπλον οὐδείς που θνητὸς ἀπεκάλυψεν. No independent
authority makes her daughter cf Nilus orodv, followed by Mr Reid
(Acad. 1 3 on the words ο Socrate ortam), maintains that Cic. never uses
the simple ablativa after orsbr ; the latter would therefore insert ο before
Nato, if Nilus stands for the god (as undoubtedly it does), and not the
river. As we have aetus aad procreationem (if the text is right) even
conceptas used with the Abl. in this book, there seems no reason why Cic.
should have objected to the same construction with ortus ,¹ and in point of
fact we find it in Pau. 11 118 quitus ortus sia, noa qatbzucam utras ceaa'a l
dero. ¹

Jove: see above ξ 53, Arnobius, Firmicus and Clam. Al. make her

daughter of Satura and say that she first used armour.

comae: ci Harpocration s. v. Ἱππία Ἀθηνᾶ, ‘Mnaseas says that the r
equestrian Athana was daughter of Poseidon and Coryphe, the daughter of
Oceanus, and that she was the inventress of chariots’. She was wor-
shipped as ‘larris at Colonos virgil attributes the invention to her son,
primas Erichthonius carrus et qrtattwr casua jungere equos(0eo.111113).
