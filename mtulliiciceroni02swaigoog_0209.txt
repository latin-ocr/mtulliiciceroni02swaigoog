tion is that by Rinck, Tritopotores Ὶῑτὶρεοῑοτοατ, lor Triptolemus and
Eubuleus are sons of Dysaules according to the Orphic tradition reported
by Pausan. 1 14 ξ 2, and monstrassem. I do not think however
that it is sale to make any change. lt is evident that the tradition followed
by Cicero's authority departs very widely from the ordinary tradition ; and
in that strange intermingling of mythologies which took place during the
Alexandrian epoch, it seems not impossible that the name Tritopatreus,
belonging to the early Attio mythology, may have been connected with the
equally ancient Anactes.

Eubuleus: this is properly an epithet or name of Dionysus ‘good in
counsel’, as we read in Plut. Ceno. p. 714, on the tert ὅτι βουλεύεσθαι παρὰ
πάτον οὐχ ἧττον ἦν Ἑλληνικὸν ἢ Περσικόν (he might have referred also to
the Germuns and Norsemon); hence ci πάμπαν άρχαῖοι τὸν Διάνοσον αὐτὸν
atomio, προσεῖπον. So, in the Orphic Hymns, Bacchus is addresmd as
Εάβονλεῦ πολύβοολε Διὸς καὶ Περσεφονείης (mx 6), und Εὖβουλεῦ μιτρηφάρε
θυρσιτινάκτα...προτογάν’ Ἠρικέττοιτ, θεῶν πατέρ η’δὲ καὶ υἱέ (114). In Η.
mm 8 Persephone is stylcd μῆτερ ἐριβρεμὶτου πολυμάρφου Εὗβουλῆοο,
while in H. sn 8 the same is said of Demeter. In Η. nrm Artemis is
called daughter of Eubuleus. Dionysus is also spoken of as son ol Eubuleus
(m l) θεσμοφόρον καλέω ναρθηκοφόρον Διόνυσον, σπέρμα πολύμνηστον πο·
λυάνυμον Εὑβοοληοτ. Again Eubuleus is identified with Pluto (addressed
in Η. xvn 12 as el πολύδεγμον Εὔβουλε), with Adonis -(addreseed in
Η. LV as Εὕβουλεΰ πολύμορφε, τροφοῦ πάντων άράδηλε), with Phanas, far
(ap. Macr. Sat. 1 18) ὃν ὃν) νῦν καλέουσι Φάνητά τε κο) Διόνυσον Εὕβουλῆά τ’
drona καὶ Ἀνταάγην ἀρίδηλον.

tortu-Atrei ulii: we οτο nowhere told that Atreus had sons so
named The famous scothsayer Melampus, who is said to have introduced
the worship of Dionysus into Graece, ie entirely unconnected with Atreus.
Then we read, in N onnus αττ 16, of an Alcon, one ol the Cabeiri, who was
son oi Hephaostus and Cabeiro and brother of Eurymedon. Tmolus is
a generally accepted emendation by Dav. for Em'olus of uss (connected
with Edroel) because the former name occurs amongst the ancestors of
Atreus 1 hare thought it better to keep to the use, as the extraordinary
eocentrioity of O.’s mythology really leaves nothing on which to build
conjecture.

ξ 54- Musae quattuor: so Tretaes ομ Hes. op, p. 6, except that the
lather is with him the first and not (as with 0.) the second Jove, Ἄρατος ἐν
τῇ πέμπτη τῶν ‘serpedo τέσσαρας (τὰς Μούσας) λέγει Διὸς τοῦ stercor xci
Πλουσῖαο νύμφην, Ἀρχὴν Μελέτην θελξινάην καὶ Ἀοιδήν. Mnaseus also, a
contemporary of Callimachus, epolre of four Muses filiae Telluris et Oceli
(Arnob. 11137, where we are further told that Ephorus made three Muses,
Myrtilus seven, Crates eight). Pausanias (τα 29) mentions that one
tradition recognised only three Muses named Μελέτη Μνήμη and Ἀοιδὴ.
