tenses), verbs such as possum, debeo, oportet are used in the indicative
in the spodosis, where the Subj. is used in the protasis, does not this indi·
cate that these quasi-auxiliary verbs were felt to take the place ol tha
Subjunctive mood; in other words that the lorea of the Subj. was felt
to be expressed by these auxiliariesl see Boetticher's Lea. Pac. p. 106
(on the pregnaut force ol the Oonjuuctive) and Nigelsb. p. 267. Lastly,
is it true that this J ussive force is confined to conditional or quasicon·
ditional sentences, as asserted by Mr Reid and hlr Nixon and apparently
by Madv. rea 11 ³5 (where he speaks of it as a particular use oi the
conjunctive qaod post condt'ctbnem, eive ea verba &presso est ricc tructbyi-
tur, ponatur ad nynificaadam tt quod fleri debuerit)l lt we are right in
connecting this use with the Deliberative and Optative uses, there seems
no c pratri reason sor limiting it ιο the conditional sentence, and certainly
there is nothing to suggest it a posteriori It would at any rate require
a remarkable power ol special pleading to explain as conditional sentenoes
all the exn cited above. Even, if we should allow that the J ussire origi-
nated in au ejaculatory hypothesis, yet such an ejaculatory use is itsell'
closely connected with the other recognized uses of the Subj, all springing
from the root conception oi the mood as expressive ol derepit iu contrast to
saon and in anycase this particularusehesoutgrown its origin aud calab
lished its right ιο be treated aa an independent· off-shoot of the root, just
es much as the Imperative, Deliberative and Optative uses I will only
add that two other exn of this use are generally cited from the N. D, samp-
a'ssee tao jars 189, and qaid enim dedissent 111 71. I have not treated
them as such myselss because I thought them capable oi another explana-
tion, but l am far from denying that Cicero and his readers may very
'probably have understood them with what we know as a ‘jussive’ force.
[I think those who object to the so-oalled jussive use oi the subjunctive

have failed to see that the ground of objection is applicabis ιο a number os Χ

other uses which no ons coisld think oi disputing. Faciat, aa faeiat,
rw fecerb in the usual imperative meaning: factat, ferent, fecisset in the
concessive uses; moriar, nwrerer in optative uses; quid apum? qaid

operam? in so·called dubitative uses; the whole class oi subjunctivae oi 3
purpose (as distinguished from subjunctivae ol result) including such usas “

es mtto at (or qia) sacrat, ροειπιὶο factat, caneo fndus, dre, all erhibit
a jussive meaning (see my Grammar ch. m), and I cau see no reason in

objecting to treat as such the verbs in At ta dictat, Albona, morarer! or in t
Quid titi nam pelago? tetra comem subm(0v.Am.1118. 49). But ¹

neither could I assert that here, as elsewhere, there are not more ways

than one of taking particular expressions. The original subjectivsiorce oi ,

the subjunctive mood was gradually specialised in vai-ioue directions, oua
phrase or class oi phrases being developed by analogy ιο some other.
Whether this jussive use was developed from the protasis of a conditional
sentence by suppressing the spodosis, or from the spodosis by suppressing
the protasis, is impossible ιο say. It may well have been a codateral to, ·
