done for the improvement of the text in my critical
notes, end something in the commentary and index
to advance the knowledge of Ciceronian Latin. As
regards the text I have always named the originator
of any improvement; in the explanatory notes Ι have
followed the example of Schdmann treating as common

for looking over the proofs of this asos my former

volumes, and to the Syndicate of the Cambridge

University Prese for undertaking the expense of

publication.
