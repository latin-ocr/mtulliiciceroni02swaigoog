RELATIONSHIP 011 MSS. XXXV

must either represent tbe archetype, emended by V' and B, or else
the fonner are derived from the same incorrect copy oi α.

5 24. fieri aaa poseant 13¹, all others accae. There can be little
doubt that aaa is what Oicero wrote, but the reading mane is not so
objectionable as 1ο call for emendation. It would seem therefore
thatB here represents tbe archetype, and that the others are oon-
nccted with it by a medium which in this instance proves to be less
trustworthy.

ἓ 26. Orionem B, orationem AOEPV. Here in all probability a
bad a contractiori wrongly interpreted by all but B*. .

§aa cientis [B]‚ scantia AOEPV. This is another evidence
showing that B is connected with the archetype by a different line oi
descent from that of the others.

542. (Lysithoe est), Lysitto eat B (perhaps Lysithoest in a),
[assito eat ACPV, labdo est E.

543. (capedunculas ib), cap. his B, ona iis AoEPV. The
demonstrative seems necessary, bnt was of course easily lostaiter -lia

ᾖ 47. ibis B, ibi AEV1, ibi O, ibes Ψ, nothing said of P. Here
0 appears to represent c, while AV have neglected to mark the
abbreviated s and B has written it out in full.

0, sitierat di P, ci sant tii di Αἱ ai suat ti dii V'. Probably a
omitted the demonstrative, as in ᾖ 43 si di 111111, where I have added
isti. Ii Oicero wrote eidi di sant, it· would be easy t'or ti to drop ⁴
out, and the variety of readings suggests that each scribe reinserted
it, where ba thought best.

552. jam B, tam OEV, and probably A¹‚ tam A¹, nothing said
ο1 P. Here B either follows aseparate tradition or has emended tha
common archetype. ⁶

mara B, mater AOEPV. An abbreviated mater might ‘

easily be mistaken formare and v.v. ihc readings may be most
easily explained by supposing two recensione of c, one followed by
AOPV (β), the other by B (γ).

554. Matenwayna [BP], raemoriae Ε, nemo aiae AOV (nemo
‘in ras' A) 1.

5 57. Cynosuris [BP], yynosaria Aolr, pinoaaria V'.

5 66. aritiam BE, eritrea AOPV. It seems more probabis that

⁴ Deitar (111. Mar. less p. 314) states thstB has credonem like the rest.
† Daiter gives amatoriae as B's readmg.
