ΟΝ THE SOURCES OF THE THIRD BOOK OF THE
DE NATURA DEORUM.

There cen be no doubt that ior the materiale oi thie book Cicero
was meinly indehted to the Carthaginien Hasdrubal, better known
by hie Greek neme Clitomachurr, who wne born about 180 nc. end
went to reside et Athene about 155. He νας for many years e
disciplc of Cerneedee end eventually became the heed of the Now
Aoedemy. Carneades himself heving left no written remeius (Diog.
lv 65, Plut. Mor. p. 328), it rrae through the voluminous writinge of
his scholar, extending to more then 400 volumen, thet his tecching
was perpetuated, ef. Diog. lv 67 διεδέξατο τόν Καρνεάδην καὶ rd
αὐτοῦ μάλιστα διὰ τῶν συγγραμμάτων ἐφώτισεν, Cic. Acaet 11 104
replicavi praelocuto Clitomacho auctore quo modo cirta Carrwodee
diceret, ih. 11 98 α Clitomacho rumam (totam Carneadi murciam)
qui oeque od eerteotutem cum Carneade suit, Sext. Emp. 11 182
ἦρῶτηνται δὲ rirrd τοῦ Καρνεάδου καὶ σωρειτικῶς τινες (λόγον), οὓς ὅ
γνώριμος αὐτοῦ Κλειτόμαχος ὥς σπουδαιοτάτους καὶ demaenetum ἅνέ·
γραψεν (referring to the argumente which Cicero hee inserted below
egle-52). We are told (Ac. 11 102) thet Clitomachus eddreesed
two of his philosophieal treetisee to Romane, one to the retinet
Lucilius, the other to Censorinus, conoul in 149 nce end thet he
was lecturing et Athene during the quaestornhip of the orator Croesus

110 ne (Orat. 1 45). Cicero mentions α trectise περὶ ἐποχῆς in τ

four books (Ac. 11 98) and e consolatio written to hie oountrymen
aiter the fell of Carthago (Tereo. 111 54). Schwencke (Jahrb. s.

olrice. Petet 1879, 2 p. 141) conjectures that the title of the treetise ¹

employed here by Cicero was περὶ προνοίας.
