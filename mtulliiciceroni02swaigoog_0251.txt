anri Tolossani: Q. Servilius Caepio, consul in ao. 106 received the
province of Gallia Narbonensis during the Cimbrian war. Thepeople oi
Tolosa (Toulouse) having joined the Cimbri, Caepio sacked their town and
templea in which were great quantities oi gold, ‘the produce oi the auri-
icrons region near the Pyrenees ...... 'l'he treasure was kept in chambers in
the temples and also in sacred tanks (Posid ap. Strab. 1v p. 188 cited in
Dict ⁰f (Jeep). Strabo l c. says, that according to another less credible
account, these trecenses were brought home by the Tectosages from the
sack of Delphi. lustin adds(m113) that in consequence they were
visited by a pestilence, from which they were not freed until οονοοι ar-
pontemque bellis recepitque φιαοοίῑιιοο ia Tolosatem lacum meyerect.
Caepio was severely punished ior this act of sacrilege. In ao. loo he
was totally defeated by the Cimbri at Arausio, and on his return to
Rome ‘he was deprived of the proconeulship by a vote oi the peoplo ·
and his property contimlcd. The next year he was expelled from the
senate by a ilnd decree citha people; and in aa 103 some oi the tri-
bunes headed by Saturninus and Norbanus proposed a special commis-
sion to inquire into the emberrlement and treason committed in Gaul.
Caepio was arrested and wndemned, and the intervention of one citha
tribunes only suoceeded in commuting the sentence oi death to one oi
exile‘ Willdns Orat. 1 p. 9. His place of exile was Smyrna: one tradition
however says that he was executed at Rome (V al. Max. vr 9 ξ 13). Strabo
