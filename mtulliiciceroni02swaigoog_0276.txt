pyre (so aron Pt. 11 ch 84, vol. rr p. 91), but the name mentioued in con-
nexion with the engine of Demetrius is not Epimachius, its actual oon-
structor (as we leam from Vitr. x 22 ξ 4), but a certain Diocleides of
Abdera ; hence it has been supposed that Diocleides was a writer, admhed
for his description of the Helepolis, or even (taking θαυμάζεται as middle,
ao Schweig. in loc.!) that he was one who expressed his admiration for in

(ln Didot's Scapt. dien. Magn. p. 133 it is quoted θαυμαζέτω.) On the ,

same principle we should understand Timaeus here te be the historiam
though it would seem from previous quotations that his description could
not have been so celebrated as that 1)] Philistus. We may form some

idea of the magnificencia of the pyre from the account giren of another
pyre by Herodian 1v 2 (quoted in Diat. os lia. under apotheosis). We
come now to the word typanidie, vanous emendations of which will be
found in Not erit, some turning on the disease, others on the plane of
burial. As we have seen that the pyra itself was so celebrated, it seems
not improbable that the name of the constructor may have been added

Professor J ebb however prefers the reading of B (tyrannidis) and refers ·in ,

out of a ssight from Syracuse 1)] the words of one of his friends, reminding
him ds καλὸν ἐντάφιον r) wpaan'r ‘the purple is a noble winding-sheet'
[cf. the words of Theodora in the sedition Δ. D. 532, as cited by Gibbon
ch.1l,‘For my own part I adhere to the marim of antiquity, that the

throne is a glorious sepulchre’. Swainson], and so τυραννῶν τὸν βίον ¹

διέτελεσεν (aanor. Pana. Tramr p. 21, where there is a wrong reference
to J. ofl'dil. v 266). There is a remarkable resemblance between these
words and those quoted above from Philistus (a writer cited in the De
Divinatione, which was written just after the N. D. and taken probably
from the same authorities), but l do not think tyrannidis roynrn is an
expression which Cic. could have used lf it meant anything, it must

mean, as Lambinus observes, ‘the extinction of the tyranny', like bustam ¹

reipublicae in Piso 9. Ishould myself suggest that the original reading
may have been something as fellone, in sno betula martana, at tyrannidis

Typanidic is right (any name with the same termination would aeoeunt

for the omission of the wonls following tyrannidis), it would probably be
after the form Alcibiades, Oannadee. According to Plutarch S. N. V. p.
