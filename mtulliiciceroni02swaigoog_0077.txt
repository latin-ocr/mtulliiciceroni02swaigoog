graph It is strange that, after announcinghis intention oi postponing
the arguments of Cleanthes, Chrysippus and Zeno to the ssi head of
his discussion, Cicero in ᾗ 20, 21 merely commences his reply to the
and head (1145, 46) and then falls back on the arguments of Zeno
and Chrysippus, dealing with the same point Schwencke proposes
an ingenious explanation of Cicero's change of plan. He thinks that
the title of Clitomachus² treatise was περὶ προνοίας; and that, when
Cicero, feeling himself unable to carry out his original intention oi
answering each argument of Posidonius in its proper order, spoke of
deferring certain arguments to the section on Providence, his real
meaning was to set aside altogether the Posidonian order and follow
that of Clitomachus instead Further he supposes Clitomachus to
have commenced his treatise with a preliminary argument on the

divine existence, just as Posidonius commences his own defence of .

the belief in Providence (11 75) by showing that it follows necessarily
from our conception of Cod. Hence it might well include the
Carneadeam argument for the mortality of all animal nature (111 29-
34) as well as tho criticism of the abovementioned arguments of
Zeno and Chrysippus. There can be little doubt that Cicero has
horrowed the criticism of these in ἓξ 21-26 from his Greek original 3
the argument in ᾖ 23 is, as we hare seen, cited by Sextus as from
Alexinns. It may be asked why the argument of the Xenophontio
Socrates is discussed out of chronological order in ἓξ 27, 28, though
it was not mentioned along with the others in§ 18. But so it is also
in 11 18. In both it comes in as an appendage to the argument from
Chrysippus: it is probable therefore that it was cited by Chrysippus
and criticizetl as a part of his argument by Clitomachus. Schwencke
finds a confirmation of his surmise as to the title of Clitomachus’
work in 111 65, where Cicero, at the commenoement of the section on
Providential Government, uses the words de quibus accuratim dia-
scandam puto. So far I am disposed to agree with him, but Ι see no
reason for doubting the Carneadean origin of ἐξ 39-65 because of

occasional allusione to the former bools Itis not pretended that any
of the topica treated of are unsuited to Carneades, and however

carelsss Cicero may have been, he was surely capable of remembering
whether the same topic had been touched on in the previous book,
and, if so, of adding to the verisimilitude oi the dialogue by making
a reference to it. Nor can I agree with Schwencke when he says that

⁴ it would be hazardous to assume the pure Carneadcan origin oi any

portion whichis not supported by a parallel in Sextus. Sextus being
