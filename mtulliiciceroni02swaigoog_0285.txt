internecioni: occurs in Attius (i. 451 Ribbeck), common in Οοοοοε
and Cic

poenis luendis: ‘when will vengeance grow weary of exacting penal-
ties for the death oi Myrtilusl' ‘when will the blood-laud come to an endl'
lit ‘when will wearinass ο1 vengeance be given to (ie. dawn upon) the
paying ο1 penalties ior the death oi Myrtilusl’ Of. the expressions dat
finem οιὲςπίὼ Att. 293 Ribb.‚ ficia curci datur ib. 5773 or should we rather
take poen. lu. as the Abi of Manner, ‘hythe exaction of penalties’l For
the subject matter et Aesch Agens. 1545 (Clytemnestra’s words of the
δαίμων Πλεισθενιδᾶν, the παλαιὸς δριμὺς ἀλάστωρ Ἀτρέως).

Myrtili : Oenomaus having promised to give his daughter Hippodamia
to the suitor who shotdd conquer him in the chariat raes, Pelops bribed his
charioteer Myrtilus the son ο1 Hermes to loosen the pin in the wheel of
his masters ehariot. This being done the chariot was upset and Oeno-
maus killed. Pelops journeying home with Hippodamia and Myrtilus
threw the latter into the sea in order tc avoid paying what he had
promised. The subsequent calamities of the house ol Pelops were attri-
buted to the dying curse ο1 Myrtilus, Eurip. Ornat. ese—1010,Soph. El.

ξ 91. utrum poetae-dixerim: ‘I should find it hard to determine
whether the poets led the Stoice astray, or the Stoica added their sanction
to the poets '. The Stoic arguments on this subject were probably such as
we read in Plut l c. pp. 557-560. Many exn. ο1 the descendants suffering
for the sins of their ancestors are given ib. pp. 556, 557, among them the
mocking justificetion made ογ Agathocles for ravaging Corcyra, ‘because
the Phaeacians had shown hospitality to Ulymes, the enemy of Sicily '.

(Cicero has cut down his original so much as to obscure the force ο1 his
illustrations. Apparently the deaths ο1 the offenders against Archilochus
and Hipponax must heve been attributed by some Stoic to the vengcancc
of the gods Cotta argues that no external cause is needed; they are
sufficiently explained by wounded feeling.)

Hipponax: ο1 Ephesus, the inventor of the ‘limping' iambic (landus
ecaton or meamea) in which the last ioot ο1 the accarim was changed
to a trochee or spondee, the fifth l'oot being always an iambus, ficurished
in the latter half of the bth century nc. He vvas notorious lor the bitter
satiras with which he revenged himself on the sculptors Bupalus and
Athenis, ‘who had caricatured his natural ugliuess’, see Hor. Epod. cited
