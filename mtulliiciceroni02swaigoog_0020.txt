Again, as the evil deplored by both writers is the same, so is the 3
remedy proposed, which isin a word the scientific theory of nature, ’

religio quac est jzutcto cam cognitimta staturae (Dte. 11 149), the

physica constansque ratio, which is opposed to superstition in N. D. 4

' writers agreed as to the fact, that the Divino existence is not incon·

sistent with the scientific theory oi nature, and es to the origin of

religious belief among mankind from the aweinspiring phenomena ’

01 nature and the orderly movements oi the-heavenly bodiea'.

From this point however the two writers draw apert. Cicero ¹

accepts aa valid the above-mentioned grounds 01 religious belief and

adds to them the general consent of mankind, the traditional faith y

of Rome, the marks of intelligence and of benevolenoe visible in the

universe ; while he ridiculas the solitary evidence on which Lucre- ,

tius appears to build his theology, that of dreams, and shows how

arbitrary and inconsistentis the Epicurean idea 01 the ‘intermundian' i
gods³. To the fortuitous conoourse of atonis and the fortuna puber- j

Lastly, while it is religio which is the curse 01 mankind according to
Lucretius, with Oicero it is superstiti& ovar and over again he dis·

the rational from the irrational‚ the holy from the unholy‚ and sums
