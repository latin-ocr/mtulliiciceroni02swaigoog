a professed philosopher was far less likely than Cicero to be tied to
one authority; and we have already seen that, where Sextus and
Cicero are both copying Carneades, Cicero occasionally supplies
details which are wanting in Sextus, Ι have myself little doubt that
the whole argumentation 01 the 3rd book is taken from Clito
machus.

A further question may be asked ss to the original author of the
mythological section, which Ι presume to have been included in the
treatise 01 Clitomachus In the Appendix on that section it is
suggested that it may have come from Mnaseas. Clemens Alex-
andrinus, quoted under Apollo, names Aristotle as his authority,
but this is supposed by Rose (11111. Pseudepipraphus p. 615 1011) to
be a mistake for Aristocles a contemporary 01 Strabo· One ean
scarcely imagine that any philosopher would take the trouble to
make out such a catalogue 01 mythologiesl inanities, but it would be
an appropriate work 101 an erudite Alexandrian Euhemerist, such ss
Mnaseas, and might then be seized upon lor polemical purposes hythe
Academias, whom Timon condemnator πλατυρημοσύνην ἀνάλωτον
‘their saltless prolixity’ (Diog. rw 67). Supposing this to be so, are we
to assume that Cicero himself translated 111 We might rather gather
lrom what he tells usin his letters, as toliis method 01 composition,
that in subordinate details 01 this kind he was accustomed to make
use of the services 01 others Thus 101 the 3rd book 01 his De officim

he writes to Athenodorus Oalvus 10 send him an alstract 01 the
treatise 01 Posidonius on the same subject (Aa xv1 11), and he tells

us 01 Tiro that he was most usclul to him in his studies 3 seo my

EDITIONS AND ILLUSTRATIVE WORKS.

As regards the text, tha Orelli-Baiter edition 01 1862 readers
all that precedes obsoleta, but an editor is bound to remember
with gratitudo the names 01 those who contributed mest to raise
the text from the state in which it was leit by ascensius in 1511
to that in which it now appears. 11 we take the lst edition of
Davies (Oamb. 1718) as our diriding line, Victorius, Paulus Manu-
tius, Lambinus, Ursinus and Gulielmius (the last in Gruter's od 01
1619) may be named, among the earlier editors, aa those who did
