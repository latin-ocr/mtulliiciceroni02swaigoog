Baiter, following Davies, gives two other fragments, one from Nonius
p. 96 on the use of the word dulcitudo, bnt the reference in Non should
be Orat 11197; the other from Arnobius 111 6, which gives an interesting
account of the feeling of the Pagans towards Cicero's dialogus, but contains
no quotation irem it. Oreuzer refers to a node.» deodatensis, bearing the
title Ciceronis Fragmenta de natura Dorum et divinatione, which is men-

APPENDIX ΟΝ ΤΗΕ MYTHOLOGICAL SEOTION. (ἐξ 41—60.)

Tne mythologice] summary given by Cicero divergcs in many
particulare from the ordinary tradition, but is in remarkable agree·
ment with what we find in four later writings, the Protrepticon of
Clemens Alexandrinus (fl. 200 a. n), the Liber· Memoriana oi Am-
pelius (fl. 250 ani), the Disputationes adverm Gentes of Arnobins
(11300 ara), the De Mercibus of Laurentius Lydus (b. 490 alt).
Are we to suppose that these writers borrowed from (licere or from
Cicero's authority Clitomachus, or was there some earlier common
sourcet There is no sign that Clemens was acquainted with the
works oi Cicero or ewen that he had any knowledge of Latin
literatum moreover he cites as his authorities, under the head oi
Apollo, Aristotle and Didymus, and adds particulare which we do
not find in Cicero, e. g. that the itb Apollo was son oi Silenus,
that some writers made a ten and oth Apollo, that the leh Miner-va
was called coryphaeis and that the mother oi the eth was Titanis.
On the other hand it is probable that the remaining three bad some
knowledge oi Cicero. Lydus quotes from his Verrine orations and
had a {air acquaintance with Iatin literature, especially with the
writings of Varr03 but he too cites other authorities, e. g. Terpander
sor the lst Dionysus, ‘the poets' ior the others, Melias, Grates,
Eratosthenes, Eumelus, under Zeus Again in many respecta he
diverges from Cicero 3 thus, besides assigning a different parentege
for the 3rd, ith and ath Hercules, he names a lth, son oi Zeus
and Maia Moreover his references to mythology are scettercd· up
and down his book, which is on the model of Ovid’s Fasti, and
can hardly have been picked out from this section of Cicero.
Arnobins probably copied from (licere, as he often quotes from the
