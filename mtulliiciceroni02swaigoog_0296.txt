N. D. and agrees with Cic. in each case as to the number of synony-
mous deities, in fact only deporta from him in making Hyperiona
the mother of Sol, and in his description of the 3rd and 4th Minerva,
making the 3rd the inventrcss os arms and daughter of Saturn
(instead of Jupiter), and the sah the Coryphasia of the Messanicus
instead of Coria the inventrcss of chariots. In the account of Sol
the divergencc may be explained by simple carelessness in that of
Minerva he has followed the Protrepticon of Clemens, which seems to
have boen one of the chief sources of his book. It must be obscrved
however that in another passage (111 37 cited in the note on Mutua
ᾗ 54) he refers to Mnaseas, Ephorus, Myrtilus and Crateras au-
thorities. Iastly Ampelius, whose treatise is an epitome of the
poorest type, follows on the whole the order of Cicero, but has the
most extraordinary divergences, introducing such names as Granicus,
Joab, Orio, Joppe, which can hardly be explained away by the
corrupt state of the text: and there are besides signs that be follows
a Greek original Thus the names Crenas Cronia are plainly Greek,

aad the phrase Joeia Aelia-ia filias seems to be a mistranslation of
Διδς τοῦ Αἰθέρος. He also adds further details, eg. that Hercula
founded the Olympias gemes (cf. Diodorus quoted on Idaeis Dicitis¹
§42 n), that he taught Atlas, that the mother of the 5th Minerva
was Titamim and even brings in a deity, omitted by Cicero, vir. Mars
Also in common with the other parallel writers he is silent as to
Pan being the child of Penelope and Mercury (ἕ 56), and as to the
names of the Muses and Dioscuri (ᾗ 53, 54).

From the above consideratione it would seem that thesaur
parallel writers must have bad access to some other authority besides
Cicero: was this authority Clitomachusl I think we may say this
is impossible in the case of all but Clemens, and not very probable
even in his case. If however· we compare semein other authors who
are to some extent in agreement with Cicero, where he departs from
the ordinary tradition, I think we shall find indications of an earlier
common source from which the tradition was derived both by
Clitomachus and by the later epitomists. Among these authors are
Servius, the Virgilian commentator, and Lactantius Placidus, the
scholiaat on Statius, in regard to three out of Cicero‘s five Mercurics
The latter names a certain Carvilius aa his authority. Athenaeus
(quoted on ἓ 42 Asteriae) names Eudoxus aa authority for the state·
ment that Hercules was son of Jupiter aad Asteria. 'I'ho contest
