nensrrorsnrr or uss. xxxiii

520. u coneretudiue enim, where enim is omitted by the other
use and given in contractiori by V. In this csse there can be little
doubt that V represents the archetype.

ἓ 35. quem ipsum noo omnes isderpretcuter uuo niodo, qui
quonium quid dicem intellegi holuit, mittamus, where the other uss
omit qui and even V seems uncertain. Baiter thinks nort omnes—enode
to be a gloss, which would naturally suggest a connecting qui before
quopiam: ou the other hand qui would easily be lost before
quoniam

fi 62. talis o philosophie pelhztur error, where the final o ot'
philosophie (which probaby commenced a new line in the archetype)
is written separately in V¹. From this the readings of the other -
stes would easily spring, uia t. a philosophiuppelhdur error A,
t. a philosophi appellatur e. 13¹0, t. philosophia appelletur e. B'
(evidently altered to melre sense), end sot. u philosophie appellatur
e. PE and V' (only that the last hes apellatur).

570. quisquamne istuc nepot by corr. in V, where A has quis-
quam iuste (iuste being ‘in ras) by a late hund), 0 peregeram istuc
BP quequae istuc (quos cancelled iu B), quid istud E. I ern inclined
to think the archetype had queisque stite (for exx. of stuc in Cicero's
use seo my ru end Lachmann¹s Lucr. p. 197), so thet here the
unsltered B and P ere its best representatives.

ξ 73. seqre ut rhode auferam (see n. in loe.) which, written
continuously in the archetype, is nearly the same es V¹ ecque tinde
auferam the other readings are easily explicshle from V, viz. rreqm
unde auf. AOEP, end ne quid inde auf. B, which may be compared
with the superscription of quid over oeque in V'.

584. moenia edixisse V, where B¹ has pewniue dixere, and
AB¹0P perusus dixisse. Here it would seem thet B must he either
taken directly from a us in which the words were not separated, or
(as I think more probable), from a rus wrongly copied from such an
archetype.

To these some would add ἕ 66, where V has pesueiciem see ih loe. '

Troe het preserved hy A odorae.

ἓ 67. posquam (so Baiter), others postquam.
568. quem elam Thyestem, see nn. Phae quern cleohthyestem,

Osnd by corr. B have quendam thyestem, V qoem dent hyestens,
(corr. rr. hyestim), E quom dent thiestem. Here there can be no
