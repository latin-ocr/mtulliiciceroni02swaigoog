ζῳογονοῦνται, τὰ δὲ ἀνθρώπινα σώματα, τῶν περ1 τὸν μυελὸν ἰχώρων συρροήν
τινα καὶ σύστασιν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς λαβόντων, ὄφεις ἀναδίδωσι 1101τοῦ10 κατιδόντιι·

01 παλαιοὶ μα’λιστα τῶν ζῴων τὸν δράκοντα τοῖς ἥρωσι daspetiacae. Al first
sight one is tempted to suppose 1110100110 must hare adduced the case

of Cleomenes as a parallel to that 01 Metellus and of Drusus (N. D. 11181),
good rnen abandoned 10 1110 malice 01 their enemies' during their life
and only tardily vindicated after their deaths. But the fragment in all
probability belongs to the lost scction 03 and the remark with which
Scaurus introduces his comment (01111111, riam ad ac medulla dre.) sug-
gests that his quotation from Cicero must have been made for the
purpose of illustrating the theory noticed by Plutarch. We hare already
met with allusione 10 spontaneous generatiorr in 11 26 (n on ipso ιιι· se
generata), and Lucretius uses this as a proci that οο creatoris needed
(11 865 ee 1100111ιῖ1001 01011111 principiis coartare, the opposite 10 Βο11100’ ab
estimantibus principiis eam (maturam) esee generalem, see l. 871 quippe
cidere licet cinos 0110111010 onnus stercoraria taetro &a and v rasfolt). We
may conclude therefore that Ootta's reference to Cleomenes formed a part
of the argument by which he endeavoured 10 disprove the doctrine of an
intelligent first cause. ¹
4. There seems no reason why this fragment should have been brack-
‘ eted by Mu. lt istrue that much the same words arc found in Off. 1 105,
1101 the providential care of man ia the subject 01 section D (cf. rrr 65), so
that Cotta could scarcely help saying something 011110 kind
b. Forthe diepam Anam 0001151 n. This is probablyapiece of care-
lessness on the part of Servius We nowhere else read that it consisted cf
3000 years. In the Hortensius, as recorded both by Serv. on Aea1 260
and 111 284, and by Tac. Or. 16, it was reckoncd at 12954. Servius however·
’ (1.0.) notices the inconsistency 01 1110 two estimatae of Cicero in the words
(magnum 0111111111) de qno carm dicamur a 11010110 et ab Eudone el a

Ptolemaeo ct ab ipso Tullio.
6. The words of Servius are ‘spirabile’...ert 1011110 camna, 0110111-

quam illc ‘spiritale' (so Thilo and Hagen with one rrs C against tha
majority of the better uss) dicerit in liora de deorum aalma Spiritalem
is the reading of Bin N. D. 11 18, arrd though the form spiritualia is mone

regular, yet we find the former· in Vitr. x 1, and possibly we ought 1ο read
it in Cicero. As for spiritabilem, it is read by 11 and Red in 11 18 (101 spira-
11110111 01 other rrss) and by the Paris codex 01 the 0111 century in Τιιισ. 1 40,
but there carr be no doubt that this is merely a corruption, like aalma·
bilae, naturabilia, 0101011110, aequabilia compared by Ma 00 Tusc. l. c

7. We naturally look to Book 11 142 foll. for this description of the
eyes, hut nothing of the kind 10 said there. We only read 11011110 ears
have duros et quari conwoion 1011011111, but this has 00 reference 10 1110
100101αο00 01 cold. Possibly Cotta may have examined in detail the Staio
panegyricon 1110 wisdom shown in the structure of the body, and in doing
so remarkcd 00 this supposed use 011110 cornea.
