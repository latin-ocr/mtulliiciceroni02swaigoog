5 54. Pieriae 0, pieriae ABE, proelias P, pleridaa V. Here it
would seem that α must heve had plcrias, variorraly corrupted in PV 3
Ο is an easy emendation.

5 65. euwahrrttne cu· reduc hortante 0, for di the otheruss herede,
which is a very natural corruption of original dt, and waa probably
the reading of α, corrected by 0.

5 7 2. quod nomae, quanto dissipes libentiae OE3 for dissipes
ABPV¹ have dbolpia, V* dissipas. Here too I think it is eaaiest to
regard C's reading as a correction ol dissipis.

5 74. deflde reolo tutele (for dre) Ο, defidefidem clatet utile A,
de fide allato tubiae B, de fide mala ct utile PV, dc fide erola
tot utiles Ε. Here A must hove arisen from a wrong division of
words (de fidem olet oble) and a double dittographia offide and at:
perhaps in athelino ended with ot. Ithinlr it probable that here too
C's reading is an emendation, as B'a certainly ia

5 83. prove O, gravem all others. Probably amiculum was mis-

tahen lor the diminutive of amicos aud so made masculine. O's read·
ing I take to he an emendation.

586. cuipiam nocuit O, quipiam n. A1B, quipprkrm rr. ‘A'V
(nothing said oi E and P). Here I think the original reading was

probably quoipiam, corrupted to quipr‘om in n, and variously emended
by V and C.

5 94. in carn OE, ineram (with r crased) A, in eram BP¹V¹‚ in
iatam P', io meram V'. Here a must have had mom, OE are no
doubt corrected ester A

Prae teet preserved hy P aloru.

5 26. conformatum [P], confirmatum others.

566. ictuc istac thir PE (perhaps 13¹), ictuc ia terebelli, ictuc
iren itit AVB¹‚ isthaec marg. V same hond. There can bc no doubt
that Phere represents a, and that the form iotae being not very
common, got corrupted in ABV; the marginal reading ol Vis pro

bably an attempt to explain istoc.
5 92. harre PV', hoec others.

Igo on to give some crucial instances illustrating the character
of the different uss.

5 13. de Scyro. All the uss have gone wrong here, ACEPV
having sacra by inadvertence, but B changes this into em to anit

the context
