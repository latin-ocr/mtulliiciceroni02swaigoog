Bo. Gritioism of particular arguments of Zeno, Chrysippus and
Xenophon §520—28.

(1) When it is said ‘the universe is best and therefore divine’, ἵ
them is an ambiguity in ‘best'. Granted that it ismost beautiful ⁴

and admirably adapted to our wants, but how is it most wisel Ii,
as Zeno says, because what is wise is better than what is not wise, 3

why not, ou the same principle, make the universe to be a mathe-
matioien or musioian‘l §yso-23.

(2) Agerinus to the argument that the regular movements oi l

the stam prove them to be divine, this is simply the regulmity oi
nature: on the same principle we should eall the tides divine.

(3) Chrysippus uses ‘better’ in the same vague way es Zeno,

end does not distinguish between nature and reason Itis nopre ,

sumption in man to believe that he is himself rational and that the
sters ere mede oi brute matter. The compurisou ol the universe to

(4) Nor is there more weight in the assumption oi the Xeno
phontic Socrates, that the rational soul oi man must have proceeded

from a rational seul in the universe, or in that (of Chrysippus) ,
that the hnrmony oi nature oan only be explained on the suppo· ¹
