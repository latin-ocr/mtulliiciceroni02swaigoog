was promptcd by policy, not by religion 3 tc suppose otherwise would
he to impute injustice to the Gods (ἓξ 11-15). This sets asida one
01 the grounds assigned for the prevalence 01 religious belief by
Cleanthes, his 2nd ground, that 01 the terrible phenomcna 0111111111,
is allowed as a fect, the two others are deferred along with the
arguments of Zeno and Chrysippus to the 31d head. Τ111 2nd branch
oi the discussion deals with the Divine nature. This begins in ξ 20
with a distinct reference to the corresponding part 01 the argument
01 Balbus (11 45). In both the questionis qualis 10111111 1111111111,-
11011111111 to the stupeiying influence 0100110111 Cotta then proceeds
to challenge Balbus' asscrtion mucidum animaruum ecee et deum, and
the proof alleged 101 11 nihil mundo cese 11111111. ‘It no more follows
110111 11111,’ hc says, ‘that the world must be possessed 01 reason than
that the city 01 Rome is a reasoning creature, 01 thetis itis not,
it must be rechoned 01 less value than the ant which is possessed 01
reason! (011145, 16.) But the same proof had been quoted 11
from Zeno in 11 21, so Cotta rccurs to that (111 22) in spite 011111
avowed intention 01 leaving it 101 the section on Providence, and
replica theton the same principle we might argue that the world
could read a book. In §23 he deals with another argument 01 Zeno's
given in 11 22, putting it in a more general 1011111111111111111)1 with a
reference 101111 Socratic argument in 11 18) ‘everything which exists
is derived from the world, and the world can produce nothing unlike
111111, therefore the human reason is a product 011111 world and
resembles ia’ ‘On the same principle,' he says, ‘we might maintain
that the world could play the liute' The next argument touched on
by Octtais that which deduces the divinity 01 the 11111 from their
regular 1110110111, apparently referring to 11 54 1011. ‘similarly we
might argue 101 the divinity of quartan fevers' (111 24). For an
examination 01 these objections see nn. on the particular passages.
In 5 25 (10111 goes back to Chrysippus (1116, 17). His lst argument
is that ‘ii there is anything in the world beyond man's power 10
melre, be who made it must be God' 5 the 2nd that ί11111111 were no
Gods, man would be the best thing in the universe, which it would
be the extreme 01 arrogance to suppose¹3 the 3rd that ‘the world is
too beautiful 10 have been built simply for the hahitaticn 01 man!
Octta’s answer 10 the lst is that it ignores the distinction between
nature and reason (which cf course has nc force against the Stoica
who identified nature with reason, and does not in the least degree
effect the inferance that there is a superhuman power at work in the
