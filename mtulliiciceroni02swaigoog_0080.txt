In 1777 some slight improvements in the text were mede 177
Ernesti's edition, hut the first edition 71 importanoe efter Davies is
that by Heindorf 1817. He was a sound scholar with 777 open eye

and independcnt judgment and, though he relied too much ou inferior
codices, especially on his Codes Glopaciomus, and was too much
disposed to 71777, yet, 11 Ι am not mistaken, an examinatior 71 my
critical 77777 will show that a larger number 71 accepted emendations

notes of F. A. Wolf and Wyttenbach given at 7177 end are mostly 71

commenced by Orelli in 1717 first edition 1826-1830. Allen (Alenus)
brought out sn edition with Latin notes, London 1836. These are
chiefly grammatical and oritical, containing some good emendations
c.g.nimiacutlide170,uercouti311 126. The edition with German
notes hy G. F. Scho'menn 1850 (1717 ond lest in 1876), isdeservedly
