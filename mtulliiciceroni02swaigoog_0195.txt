not in doing or making, but in Oropia (ib. x 8 ξ 7) πράξειε δὲ ποίας ἀπονεῖμαι

in his Hermotonap. Aug. De Trio, xv1 9 ξ 12), which, usByweter has shown
(Ι. cs Pla. 11 p. 62), was probably taken from Aristotle’s Protrepticur, ‘in
the hlands ol the Blest there will be no use of eloquence or eren of virtue,
nec enim fortitudine ερονειηαο, nullo proposito oret labore aot perr'e‘ulo, occ

ἅοίαοειιρεοροιίιο bornum et cicurum& So Plotinus : tf, es Plato says, we
are mede like to God by virtue, it would seem thet we must ascribe virtue
to God : but ie itin accordnnce with resson to ascribe to Him the politiccl
virtuesl (lod is the exemplar ol ull virtue, end men receives his virtue
from Him, but the divine goodness is something beyond virtue. Whut we
term virtues eremerely purificator-y habits, the objectos which is to free
the soul imm the bondege of the flesh. With God virtue is nature, with
man it is effort end discipline’ (α brief ahstrect oi Eure. 1 2). On the

Ohnstian Futhers were divided on the subject, Origen maintaining thet καθ’

διδασκόμεθα, but carefully distinguishing this from the similarly expressed
Stoic doctrine(0ele. v1 48); while Clement (Strom. vn ξ 88 p. 320) and
Theodorei (Sem 11 De liin et lud.) cited in Spencer's n.‚ speek of the
letter es a during end impious opinion clement tries to explain away the
text cited by Origen (Mett. v. 48); but there can be no doubt thst the
Christian Revelution proceeds throughout on the supposition oi the real
identity oi goodness in (lod end men, und that this lies ct the very hcert
οἱ the doctrine of the Incarnation. The Christian definition of virtueis
the divine Spirit working in the heart of men under the conditions of
humenity. In so fer es men is virtuous, in so fer he approoches the ideol,
God manifest in the flesh. Our idea of the goodncss of (lod is simply
goodness, as we know it in mun, but stripped of its association with weck-
ners 'l'hus we speek of God es holy, leving, just, wisc, but not ns comugeous
cr temperate, because these letter qualities imply the coexistence of a lower
nature with the higher. See Aquinus Summa 1 qu 21 unctum moralium
