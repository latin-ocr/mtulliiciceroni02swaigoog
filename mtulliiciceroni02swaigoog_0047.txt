5 46. sanum est BPV', sanae est AOV¹ (in A ι erased), fannus
E. Probably a had sanet et, corrected in BP.

5 47. lucus Alavsst lucos P making it the object of interpretor,
lueis B¹ perhaps to suit Attenia, locata O.

5 51. Aequi A¹PV¹, arcui B, arcus A'V', arci OF. Arquiis
plainly the reading of α, of which tha others are corruptions.

5 56. Argum dieder interemisse [A¹Bon], arpentum d ι’. A¹Pv.
Probably a bad an abbreviation, misread by the first recensicn (β),

- but rightly interpreted by B and emended by Ο. -

Aegyptam prffuqiaee [OE],. aeyyptum prrrfuiase AB¹V¹,
aeqypto praefuisse B'PV'. Ithink a must have agreed with ABV,
and that O and P are emendations.

5 64. ᾱιιοιιιιιι indigna ruderis Madv. conj„ diocliae ipams
now, dic alio ιιιιι iqraeia V¹, rimamus dignata de dyo n, dicamus
diyaa dia B. As ru, ιι, nand liare frequently interchanged in the
uss, there is no difficulty about the first word, but how are vva to
explain the change from indigua naturis into ιι iprwia? The last
syllable is an abbreviation tornatioris, so the problem is how ιο
change indigitandis into ιι tynam The disappearance of the repeated
aa explains itself and we are lest with ιι followed by hiatus ιο repre-
sent aad. If this is a correct account of the readings in AOPV it is
plain that B and E are merely conjecturat

per mare BPV and (with re on erasure of four letters) A,
permanere OE aud probably A¹.

5 65 fin. ai ob rem (see my n), ai orbem V, niobem adn, niobe
B ; injuram 0¹, aa labem P, orn. cdd. with some inferior uss. No
one has attempted to offer any explanationes tha oldest readings 3 it
hasbeen assumed that Niobe in B was a gloss giving the name of the
speaker, bnt why in the world should Niobe have been selectedl
If triobrem were the reading ol a, this would naturally be changed
into the more familiar ιιι’ orbem or Nioben, and B would naturally try
ιο make sense by dropping the ru.

569. pestifera est multis admodum paucis salutaris. Instead of
est A¹BEPV¹ have siat, dA¹v¹ ait, in place of the original et,· B
retaining the plural menda the grammm by reading salutaria.

5 70. nocue Deianira voluit AOEPV, ιι. Dianae ira coluit B by
an ingenious emendation.

572. meamet BPA⁹V²‚ ιιιιαιι et A¹v¹un Ishould suppose
that B represents a, misread by β and corrected by P.

5 74. baec cotidiana, ιιιοι, venena AGEPV, Ιι. c. sica ι. Β

(altering the number ιο maha it agree with cotidiana).
