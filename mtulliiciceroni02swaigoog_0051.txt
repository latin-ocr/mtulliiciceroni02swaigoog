musmonem OF MSS.

This egrees ieirly with Forohhsmmer's view (N ordisk rihtest
for 1880, p. 23 foll), exeept thet he does not recognize nny eennexion
between E end the lst line of desoeut (β), whereas meny instuuoes

will be iound ebore in which E agrees with A end Ο egeinst B.

I think eleo he is wrong in speaking oi the group (y) es esoms'lio

less trustworthy, eud though it is more often the sole represen-

ullied with OPV, where A is right, these ure usually right with it
It moy be worth while to edd thet the texts used by Priscian

und Probus seem ιο heve been in some respecto better then our
archetype, ef. 11 117, 118 ond 91 ior Proh. 106, for Priscian
