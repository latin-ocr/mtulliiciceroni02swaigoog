hensible of the three is the mythologieal section‚ in which he attempts
to show that there were many separate deities confused under the
same name. In speaking of these as insertione, I do not mean that
the letand 3rd are exclusively due to Cicero and had nothing
corresponding to them in the Greek original, but that in all three
cases a very subordinate point hae been allowed to swell out beyond
all proportion, and that in order to make room tor them, matters
of real interest and importunos have been either omitted or curteiled

without piety luith and justice cannot exist and all societyie eub-

vidential government of the world ; there can be no such thing ss
worship, unless we believe that the gods are intereeted in men and
are able and willing to benedt them. But we must be able to give
a resson for our saith, and not embraoe an opinion without investi-
