Aglacpfa pp. 465 foll. 994 foll In order to reconeile inconsistent legende
the mythologists multiphed the gods, just ss the harmonists have multi-
phed the miracles oi the Gespels in order to avoid seeming contradictioni,
sce for example the commentatore on Matt xx 29. The true explana·

became variously modified in different localities, (2) that the Greeks and
Romans identified their own divinities with those of foreign natione, in

and leucothea The mythologioal section‚ which follows, differs very
much from the iuual tradition, but is to a certain extent in agreement
with four later writers, whom I have compared in the Appendir, via
Clemens Alexandrinam, Arnobius‚ Ampelius and Laurentius Lydus But
there ars many points in which (lic. differs both from these and from
every other ancient mythologist known to us Though I have not been
able myself to arrive at any definite conclusion as to the sources of the
tradition followed by Carneades, I hope thet the comparative view given
in the Appendix may be of use to others who are interested in the history
of mythology; audit willat any rate show the need of cantion, in
assimilating the terte of the parallel writers

deities named Hercules, finally coming to the conclusion that manea qai
forster feceram Heroides mactamur (Serv. ad Aca. vm 564). Herodotus
(11 «14) distinguishes the Egyptian and Phoenician from the Greek Hercules,
whom he regarded as much the youngeet, and says that in any case we
must separate the hero from the god ; see nu. in Rawlinson's ed. Compare

whether the queen bee in the hive close by has a sting or not '. Pausanias

worshipped in Graece (v 14 ξ 7, rx 27 ξ ὅ).
