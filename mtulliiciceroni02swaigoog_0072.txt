111, and therefore reason from the great source 11 reason, ie. from (eod
(N. D. 11 18). It is objected that we might similarly argue ‘man hae bile,
therefore the universe must be bilious', but the argument appliee only
'to pure clemente, not to secondary compounds such ae bile. Putting it
in another way we might say ‘if there were nothing earthy ln the
universe, there could have been nothing earthy 11 man; 11, 11 there were
nothing rational in the universe, there could have been no 11111111 men’
§5 92-98 (N. D. 11127). On seeing a statue we admire the ekill of the
sculptor, shall we 111 do the same when we think cf the mind 11 man,
which is 11 111 more marvellous 11111 any 11111111 11 99, 100 (N. D. 11 81).
Argument 11 Zeno: that from which the seeds 11 111111 proceed must
111111 be 11111111, 111 all subordinate faculties testify 111111 character 111111
ἡγεμονικόν from which they are derived; since then the universe contains
the seeds 11 ull rational creaturos, the ἡγεμονικόν 11 the universe must
be rational, and therefore divine §§ 101-103 (N. D. 1122, 29, 30). Argu-
ment 11 Zeno efter Plato: 11111 that which 1111111111 and rational 11
superior 11 that which is 1111111111 and inational, the universe, being
supreme, must be a rational animal. The objection 11 Alexione, that 11
the same ground the universe might be proved 11 be a poet and gramme
rien, confounds the absolute and the relative beet; Archilochus was a
poet, but he was not therefore superior 11 Socrates who was 11 poet
§§ 104-110111, D. 11 18, 21). ’1111811111 prove the divinity 11 the world

ι from its motion, which must proceed from nature 11 volition or necomity.
It is certainly not the last, in the sense 11 an irrational vortex, such as

Democritus held, 111 11 11 orderly, unchanging and harmonicus Itis 111
eaumd by an unconscious nature, since 11111 would be inferior lo tbe
rational 11111111 included in the universe. It must therefore be caused by a
rational nature. Further, voluntary movemenfe are always more admhable
than those which are involuntery. When we admirc the ephere of
Archimedes, it 11111 the moving frame we wonder at, but the rational
volition 11 the astronomer. Again, tho more wonderful the thing movcd,
by 11 much more wonderful 11 the moving 11111. Hence the force which
moves the entire universe is tho 11111 admirable of all things and being
such it must bea rational end voluntary agent, ie. (lod §§ 111-118
(N. D. 1143, 44, 88). In every organism there is a centre 11 1111111, the
beart 11 the brein or, in plants, the root; the ἡγεμονικόν 11 oentre of motion
11 the universe 1111 (111111 lle-len (N. D. 11 1111). Absmditiee
arising from atheism (c). If there are no gods, there is no such thing as
piety, which ie defined 11 ἐπιστήμη θεῶν θεραπείας, 111 there can bc no
science 11 the non-existent( 1233 111 aa 111111111,111 1111111 defined aa

Pythagoras and others erroneously extendcd 11111 fellowehip to irrational
creatures, with which it 11 true we ere connected by common participation
