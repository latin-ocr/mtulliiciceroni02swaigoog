Again, there can be no divination 11 there are no gods, since itis the scienoe

Sextus, having discussed objections as they occurred, has not reserved
a separate section 101 their refutation (d), but goes on, after another
insignificant vcrbal quibble by Zeno, 10 state the negative argument in
ξ 137. 11 11110111 this point that the comparison with N. D. 111 becomes
important. If there 110 gods, they are animala, since animal nature is
superior 10 all other nature; but [animale are defined by the property of
sensation, and the gods, as the most perfect animale, will experience the
greatest variety 01 1011111001 (aa Carneades says); they will therefore
hare sensatione 01 taste, such as bitter and sweet, pleasant and unpleasant;
butan unpleaeant sensation implies possibility 01 change 101 the worse,

nature or contrary 10 their nature ; but that which is contrary 10 nature
is destructive 10 life, therefore again all animale are 11101111. This shown
in regard 10 eye-sight in particular ἐξ 142-145 (N. D. 111 33). Every
sensatior is au alteration; 1 deity who undergoes alteration 11 hable 10

infinite; if infinite, it would be liselees and motionless, for motion must
be 110111 place to place, which is impossible 101 that which fille 111 spacc;
again if held together by seul, this must be by means of centripetal

finite is contained in the infinite, us the part within the whole, so that

deity is either bodied or bodiless; 11 the latter, it can neither feel 1101

he must have all happiness and all virtue, but he is without ἐγκράτεια and
καρτερία, 101 there is nothing which he finds it hard to bear or to abstain
from §§ lea-155 (N. D. 111 38). Further, if he 1111 not got these
virtues, he must have the opposite vices, since there is nothing in-

is evident that he would be liable to distress and therefore 10 destruction
