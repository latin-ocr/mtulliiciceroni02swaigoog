that he has reason and that the stare are without it (shirking the
question and also assuming what the Stoica denied) 3 to the 3rd that
the world was not built but formed by nature (what nature forms is
built, according ιο the Stolos ; but this argument, like the ethereis
equally true, put into its most general form: the beauty of the
universe is only very partially explained by the pleasure or utility
which it affords to man). In ξ 27 Ootta proceeds with the argument
quoted from Xenophon (11 18), ‘whence did man obtain reason if it
did not exist in the worldl' to which he makes the seme irivolous
auswer as he had done ιο the similar questions of Zeno. Then comes
(in§ 28) an approving reference to the sympathy which unites all the
parts of the universe, but it is denied that this affords any ground for
believing that the universe is pervaded by a divine spirit or breath3
it is all the unconscious operation of nature. Here again we have
simple essertion on the part ol the Academica. The vague term
nature was explained by the Epicureans, frum the analogy of material

objecta, to mean atoms moving in a vacuum according ιο the laws os ,

gravitation modified by the individual clinamen, by the Stoica, from
the analogy of the scul, ιο mean the reason and will embodied in
the universe3 the Academica, clinging to their unanalysed conception
of nature, opposed their simple denial ιο both.

There is more weight in the argument by which Carneades en·

deavoured to show that if the world isan animal it must be liable to ,ι

destruction and therefore not divine. As corporeal it ie discerptible ;
as a compound of contrary and perishable clemente, it is liable to ily
aaunder and perish; as animated and therefore capable oi feeling, itis
liable to sensatione oi pain and susceptible oi 'death (ᾖ 29-34). It
is partly met by the Stoic doctrine cl the cyolio renovati0n‚ partly by

denying that the capacity os pleasure involves the possibility ol pain ·’

and that this latter involves the possibility of death. In ᾗ 35-37

Cotta has no difficulty in showing that fire is not more divine than
the other elementa

After this follows an interesting argument on the competibility ἵ

of the ideas oi virtue and divinity (S 38). As we may sce by com·
paring Sextus, this hes been very much cut down by (licere. The
quotations in the notes will show with what limitations it holds good
'Phe subordinate deities of the Stoioe are subjected to a severe criticism
in ᾖ 39-64. Ιι is shown that Stoic allegoriaation is purely arbitrary,
that it is impossible to draw the line between the human and divine
