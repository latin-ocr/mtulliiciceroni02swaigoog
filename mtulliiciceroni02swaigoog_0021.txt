established in the time of Polybius, who however does not altogether
condemn the latter in vt 56), reram aiam nrojores narni superm-
tirmem ο reiigione separaverant ,· while at the same time the ieet that
he thinks it necessary to claim the authority of ancient naage ior his
own distinction, may perhaps be regarded as an indication that it was
not yet fully recognized. It was apparently unknown to the author
oi the treatise ad Herennium, who couples religio with meato and
other passione which impel ιο avil (11 34); but it seems ιο have been
observed by all later writers. Thus, while Lucretius always uses religio
in a bad sense and ¹never uses superstitio at all, his imitator Virgil
reserves religio for what is laudable and speaks oi οοιιο superstitio rete·
rmrrpue ἰροοιο &mern (Aere. vm 187), and so Horace rechons tristia
superstitio among the diseases ot the mind (Sat. 113. 79). Perhaps
it may be thought that the differenoe between Cicero and Lucretius
is not a differente of meaning as ιο the. word religio, but a differente
of feeling and judgment as regards the facts denoted by the word,
Such a view would be quite occentent with the supposition that
Cicero'a dialogus is intended in part as s protest against the doctrine
advocated by Lucretius; but Lucretius himself asserta more than
once that his doctrino is not hostile ιο religion, as Cicero would under-

stand that word¹. In either case it seems ιο rna clear that, while
Ι agreeing with Lucretius as ιο the evils wrought in the name of religione
Cicero wished to make it plain ιο all men that these evils did not*

flow from religion rightly understood, but from its corruption, which .

he distinguished by the name of serperstitio; and that aa indiscrimi-
nate attack on all that went under the name oi religion was even
mora injurious to society than superstition itaeli

Assuming then that Cicero had this double practical aim in
writing his treatiee, first ιο eradicate superstition, second, to show
the importunae ofa rational religion3 and that he combines with
this the speculative aim of completing his system and expounding to
his countrymen the theological views oi the leading Greek philo
sophera, we have next ιο consider how this design has been canied
outl If we compare the impression produced upon us by reading the
