by Python ’. Perhaps Sileni filius has boen lost after quartus. Nowhere
else do we read that he was the legislator of Arcada or born there.
Legislation wes however regarded as an office of the Delphian Apollo, cf.
Plat. Rep,1v 427 (we leave ta) Apollo at Delphi) τά τε μέγιστα sul κάλλιστα
καὶ πρῶτα τᾶν νομοθαπημάνων...οὗτοο γᾶρ δήπου rideris wepl τὰ τοιαῦτα πᾶσιν
α’νθροίποιο πάτριος ἐξηγητὴς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς γῆς ε’πί τοῦ ὀμφαλοῦ καθήμενος

194, Strabo xvr 38, Cic. Dic. 1 96. So above Mercury is called the
legislator of Egypt.

§es prims vals et Proserpinae: Ampelius is the only other
writer who gives this parentage. Artemis is however sometimes identified

both with Persephone and Hecate, as in the Orphio hymn cited by Porphyry
ap. Euseb. Pr. Ev. lv 23 ἥδ’ ε’γαί εἶμι Κόρη παλυφίοματοςκ.τ.λ.; and. we heve
had many cxx oi the confusion between parent and child, eg. ξ 33 on
Proserpina

puratum Cupidinem: Pausanias (rx 27) says that Olen calls Eileithyia
(ie. Artemis, see ou 11 68) mother of Eros The winged Eros is spoken of
by Plato Phaedr, 252, Eur. He'pp. 1270, Aristoph. Ac. 574 and 697, where
the Scholiast says that it was only in later· times thet Eros and Victory
were represented with wings.

pater eps: this is another mythological ὄπ. λεγ. According to
Herodotus (rv 35) Opis sud Arge were two Hyperboreas maidens who
cerne to Delos with Apollo and Artemis, and were invoked by the Delion
women and the Ionians generally in s hymn composed by Olen. In the
pseuchlatonic Ariorica p. 371 we are told that the Magien Gobryas was
shown two braren platos at Delos, giving sn account oi what bosel the soul
atter death, and that these platee were said to have been brought there
from the Hyperboreans by Opis and Hecaergos In Gallim. Dian. 204
Opis is addressed as Οὗπι drucc’ etim φαεσφόρε, καὶ δέ σε κείνην spernes
καλέουσιν ἐπωνυμίην ἀπὸ νύμφην, where see Spanheim; also ib. 240 ;
Macrob. Sat. v 22; Serv. ad Aere 11 532 alii putant Opim ct Hecaergon
nmmos Apollim et Dionae some: hinc Opim ipraam Dianam Apollinem
vcro Hecaergon We do not elsewhere find Opis or Upis regarded es
masculine. Callimachus (Del. 292) makes her a daughter of Boreas, and
gives her two sistere Loxe and Hecaerge; Virgil (Aeo. x1 032 and 836)
introduces her among the attendant nymphe of Diana; Palaephatus
(Incred. ξ 32) says it is a Lacedaemonian name for Artemis3 finally
we read in Athen. xrv 10 thet hymns to Artemis were called οὔπιγγοι
'l'he name is generally derived from ὅπις--νὲμεοιη but Preller explains it
as ‘the eye of night ', ie. the moon Of Glauce we do not read elsewhere
in this connexion.

primum Jove et Proserpina: so Ampelius and Lydus in Appendix.
The letter cites Terpander the Lesbian as the authority for the tradition.
