But does not Cicero himself spenls ot* the Dc Natura Deorum se Ι
elreedy published st the time of his writing the De Dietnationa and
the De Fotol Compare Diu. 1 8, where Quintus says perleui tuum
poulo ante tertium de cataractarum in quo dieptdatio Cottae, quene- ς
quam labefactavit sententiam mecm, non funditus tamen sustulit, to
which Marcus replies Optime vero, etenim ipse Cotta eie disputat, ut
Stoicorum mepte mpuntenta confutet quam'bominum deleat reltpionem.
Quintus regende this protest es a mutter of form dicitur quiden istuc ,
ne communie jura miprart oideatnrp ced studio contra Stoicos die·
serendi deos milei vidden fiaaditue tollere: ejus rationi nore eane ⁴
desidero quid respondem,- eatae enim deserum reliqio est in moundo
libro a Lucilio, cujus dispunctio tibi ipe, m in extumo libro scribis,
ad veritatem eet oica propeneior. Agnin in Diu. 11 3 quibus rebus f
editoe (ie. the Homndm, Academica, De Finibus, Tusculano), tres
citri perfecti eunt de natura deorum ; to which he sdds others efter-
¹neumis. It may be thought thet these quotations settle the question
end thet Oieero himself is responsible for the book in its present
stete whether finished or unfinishcd. But is it not permissible to
draw s different conclusion from the opposition of the words editi Ἴ
end perfecti in the lest passagel The Hortensius end other dialogues ¹
were published, the Natura Deorum was what we should cell ready
for the prees So in Fac. 1 l we find s distinction mede between
quod in aliie libris soci qui sum de natura deorum, end the books
qnos de dicimtimte edidi. We ere not bound to tnhe literslly the ς
statement that Quintus hed send the hook ol* which he is supposed to
speels in Dio.1; evenis he hed done so, it might heve been from having
necess to the original sss. We know thet other works of Cicero wem
published niter his death, such ns the Epistles and probebly some of
the Oratione hylico, sud, among his philosophiosl worhs, the un-
finished depes. If the Natura Deorum was still unpublished et the ,
time of Cicero’s murder, end if the ns wes us much altered end
emended nuthet of the De Gloria, of which he says to Atticus (m 3)
miei ἀρχέτυπον ipsum meite loce inculcatum et resectum, this would
go fer to explain the existing roughnesses end inconsistencies ol the
dialogus.
